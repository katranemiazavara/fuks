            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You might have been hearing about the AQI lately. How does it work and what does it mean?</p><p>It starts with arbitrarily defining numbers based on a scale of good to hazardous.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uYLChmL6H2MTBtH-5E7rKg.png" /><figcaption><a href="https://www.epa.gov/wildfire-smoke-course/wildfire-smoke-and-your-patients-health-air-quality-index">Image from the EPA</a></figcaption></figure><p>The next step is picking pollutant concentrations that correspond to those levels. These are called breakpoints. For example, with wildfire smoke and general pollution, the main hazard is the fine particulate matter, also called PM2.5. PM2.5 concentration is measured in micrograms per meter cubed (µg/m³). The AQI breakpoints for PM2.5 are:</p><figure><img alt="Good: 0–12 µg/m³ Moderate: 12.1–35.4 µg/m³ Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups: 35.5–55.4 µg/m³ Unhealthy: 55.5–150.4 µg/m³ Very Unhealthy: 150.5–250.4 µg/m³ Hazardous: 250.5–500 µg/m³" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/840/1*PQHAPLRi9d-q8i-ueUEv0g.png" /></figure><p>The AQI value for that pollutant is then calculated as a linear scale between the breakpoint values. For example, if the outdoor PM2.5 level is 45.5 µg/m³, that is half way through the 3rd category of “unhealthy for sensitive people” (half way between 35.5–55.4 µg/m³) . Since that category goes from 101–150, half way would be around 126, so the AQI for an outdoor PM2.5 concentration of 45.5 µg/m³ would be 126 .</p><p>Here’s a figure for what the values look like.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/882/1*GINP_7VqW82X9gRgOddSPQ.png" /></figure><p>This can be done with other outdoor air pollutants like nitrogen dioxide and ozone. All the AQI values are calculated for the different pollutants and the largest one is used.</p><h3>Air Quality Health Index</h3><p>Canada uses a different scale. Its a formula that takes into account ozone, nitrogen dioxide and PM2.5 concentrations. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3155/1047-3289.58.3.435">The formula is</a>:</p><p>AQHI = 96.1 x (e^(0.000537xO)-1) + (e^(0.000871xN)-1)+e^(0.000487xP)-1<br>Where O is ozone concentration in ppb<br>N is NO2 concentration in ppb<br>P is PM2.5 concentration in µg/m³</p><p>Assuming recent values of outdoor ozone (30 ppb) and NO2 (4 ppb), the AQHI scales almost linearly with PM2.5 concentrations.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/896/1*47kTDGwyadZrYL8_LzC1Bw.png" /><figcaption>The AQHI values as a function of PM2.5 assuming an ozone concentration of 30 ppb and a nitrogen dioxide concentration of 4 ppb (typical recent values).</figcaption></figure><p>This scale does not completely reflect reality because as one pollutant increases, it is likely that other pollutants will increase as well. For example, smog will have higher concentrations of both PM2.5 and ozone. The scale used is assuming ozone and nitrogen dioxide remain constant for the purposes of showing the relationship between PM2.5 and AQHI.</p><p>These AQHI values correspond to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/understanding-messages.html">messages</a> to the population.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/931/1*zCMir2rqfWsM81IltP_Qjg.png" /></figure><h3>What should the PM2.5 concentration be?</h3><p>In the AQI, a PM2.5 concentration above 35.5 µg/m³ is when values start becoming unhealthy. The corresponding AQHI concentration is also around 35 µg/m³.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/pm-pollution/national-ambient-air-quality-standards-naaqs-pm">EPA</a> has set maximum exposure national standards in the US for a concentration of 35 µg/m³ as a daily average and 9.0–10.0 µg/m³ as an annual average.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240034228">WHO</a> has set a standard for maximum exposure of 15 µg/m³ as a daily average and 5 µg/m³ as an annual average.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/healthy-living/guidance-fine-particulate-matter-pm2-5-residential-indoor-air.html">Public Health Agency of Canada</a> has not set any standard, stating “indoor levels of PM2.5 should be kept as low as possible, as there is no apparent threshold for the health effects of PM2.5.” Creating a limit might imply that if you are below the limit, the exposure is safe, which is not the case for PM2.5. Therefore, this appears to be a reasonable position.</p><p>However, this position has had drastic consequences. Action is only required when limits are exceeded. In ventilation standards (ASHRAE 62.1.6.1.4.2), improved filtration is only required when the national limit of PM2.5 is exceeded. Since Canada has failed to set a limit, improved filtration is never required.</p><p>Overall, PM2.5 is a significant health hazard and the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4409736">most harmful</a> of airborne pollutants. It should be kept as low as possible through the use of <a href="https://itsairborne.com/introduction-to-air-filtration-172704a73dd4">high efficiency filtration</a>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=7e05e10aebae" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://itsairborne.com/what-is-the-air-quality-index-7e05e10aebae">What is the Air Quality Index?</a> was originally published in <a href="https://itsairborne.com">It’s Airborne</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

There are simple steps to take to protect yourself.</p><h3>Filter, Filter, Filter</h3><p>Filtration is the main tool to remove smoke from the air.</p><ul><li>Run HEPA filters and use DIY Corsi-Rosenthal boxes in occupied spaces. Ensure proper <a href="https://itsairborne.com/how-to-pick-an-air-cleaner-31c238bcd91f#8f9f">air distribution</a> when running them.</li><li>Upgrade the filter in your furnace to at least MERV-13 or MPR1900 and run the furnace continuously.</li><li>For commercial spaces, upgrade the filters in air handling units to MERV-13.</li></ul><h3>Ventilation is a Problem</h3><p>Supplying outdoor air to the space is generally the main tool we use to control indoor air quality. When you replace indoor air with outdoor air, you are removing indoor air pollutants and supplying outdoor air pollutants. The vast majority of the time, outdoor air has a much lower concentration of pollutants than indoor air, so this approach works well. It doesn’t work during wildfire events. Ventilation should now be reduced:</p><ul><li>Keep windows closed.</li><li>Turn off HRVs or ERVs that are connected to furnaces.</li><li>Close outdoor dampers on air handling units, recirculate the air and filter it instead.</li><li>Keep bathroom exhaust fans off as much as possible. They force outdoor air to infiltrate the building.</li><li>Still run the range hood while cooking, but try to limit the time it is on.</li></ul><p>It’s important to note that eliminating ventilation is not a tool by itself to create a safe space. It should be combined with filtration to ensure there is a low concentration of smoke and other particulate matter in the space.</p><h3>Avoid Going Outdoors</h3><p>We should be making the indoors safe now to protect us from the outdoor air. Limiting time outdoors can prevent exposure to wildfire smoke. If you are going outdoors, wearing a respirator, like a N95, can prevent exposure. Please see the <a href="https://ospe.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Face_Covering_Guidance_Mar15.pdf">OSPE masking documents</a> for more information.</p><h3>Gaseous Pollutants and Activated Carbon Filters</h3><p>There are gaseous pollutants that are still a problem and can be also increased because of wildfires. The main concerns are volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ozone and nitrogen dioxide.</p><p>The first tool is source control. Eliminate sources of these pollutants indoors.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*peTCXP0nMmfuZD1k9yRAOA.png" /><figcaption>Indoor air quality source control guidance from Health Canada. <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/healthy-living/infographic-improve-indoor-air-quality.html">https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/publications/healthy-living/infographic-improve-indoor-air-quality.html</a></figcaption></figure><p>Activated carbon filters can be used to reduce the concentration of these gaseous pollutants. In many portable air cleaners, these might not be effective as a long term strategy as they saturate and are not as well standardized as the particulate matter filters. Ventilation is usually used to control VOC levels, but since that is not an option now, activated carbon filters can help.</p><h3>Other Resources</h3><p><strong>Heath Canada:</strong> <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke/wildfire-smoke-health.html#toc1">https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/air-quality-health-index/wildfire-smoke/wildfire-smoke-health.html#toc1</a></p><p><strong>CDC:</strong> <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/wildfires/duringfire.html">https://www.cdc.gov/disasters/wildfires/duringfire.html</a></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=220bb5750562" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://itsairborne.com/protecting-yourself-from-wildfire-smoke-220bb5750562">Protecting Yourself from Wildfire Smoke</a> was originally published in <a href="https://itsairborne.com">It’s Airborne</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

This comprehensive guide is here to help you navigate through the noise and make an informed decision.</p><h3>How Much Clean Air Do You Need?</h3><p>Determining the amount of clean air necessary for your space is crucial when selecting an air cleaner. This measurement is commonly referred to as the Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR), and it is typically quantified in cubic feet per minute (CFM), liters per second (lps), or cubic meters per hour (m³/h).</p><p>The industry-standard approach, as <a href="https://ahamverifide.org/ahams-air-filtration-standards/">recommended by AHAM</a> (Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers), is to use the 2/3 rule. According to this rule, the CADR should be 2/3 of the area measured in square feet. For instance, if your space is 300 square feet, the air cleaner’s CADR should be calculated as 300 x 2/3 = 200 CFM. This provides five air changes per hour in residential spaces with 8-foot ceilings, or 4.4 air changes per hour in most commercial areas with 9-foot ceilings.</p><p>When using metric units, the calculation follows the 3.4 rule. If your space is 100 square meters, the recommended CADR for a HEPA filter would be 100 x 3.4 = 340 lps.</p><p>To summarize, the formulas for sizing an air cleaner are as follows:</p><p>CADR (CFM) = Area (ft²) x 2/3 <br>CADR (lps) = Area (m²) x 3.4 <br>CADR (m³/h) = Area (m²) x 12.2</p><p>Please be aware that some manufacturers report the area that their device cleans, but do not use the 2/3 rule. For example, Austin Air uses a 1/6 rule. For their product with a CADR (they call it true air flow) of <a href="https://www.austinair.ca/blogs/austin-air-blog/understanding-cfm-and-true-air-flow-rate">250 CFM</a>, they claim it cleans <a href="https://www.austinair.ca/products/healthmate-hm400-standard-air-purifier">1500 sq ft</a> where AHAM would state it is only appropriate for 375 square ft. Their standard is 4 times lower than what is adhered to by AHAM. It’s best to calculate the CADR yourself.</p><h3>Noise</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*5GYYtpY2TX5gCHjkAA95mQ.png" /></figure><p>When it comes to portable air cleaners, three main issues often arise: noise, air distribution, and human operation. Among these, noise is typically the most significant concern. To determine acceptable noise levels for different settings, <a href="https://cleanairstars.com/filters/">Clean Air Stars</a> provides a rough guide:</p><p>Bedroom: &lt; 40 dBA<br>Classroom &amp; Quiet Office: 40–45 dBA<br>Loud Office &amp; Childcare: 45–50 dBA<br>Loud Restaurant &amp; Gym: &lt; 60 dBA<br>Very loud environments: &gt;60 dBA</p><p>It is uncommon to find air cleaners advertised with noise levels below 45 dBA which is required in many settings. To address this, one approach is to run the air cleaners on lower speeds and purchasing multiple units. For more insights into tackling the noise issue associated with HEPA filters, refer to <a href="https://itsairborne.com/solving-the-hepa-filter-noise-problem-8fb3fdb37f98">this post</a> on solving HEPA filter noise problems.</p><p>The Clean Air Stars selection tool also aids in accounting for noise when choosing an air cleaner. By factoring in noise levels, you can make an informed decision that meets both your air purification needs and noise tolerance levels.</p><h3>Efficiency vs. Effectiveness</h3><p>When evaluating air filters, it’s essential to understand the difference between efficiency and effectiveness. Efficiency refers to the percentage of particles a filter can remove in a single pass. For instance, a HEPA filter can remove approximately 99.95% of particles, while a MERV-13 filter, which is less efficient, may only remove around 77% of particles.</p><p>On the other hand, effectiveness in the context of air cleaners is measured by the Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR). A higher CADR indicates a more effective unit. The CADR of an air cleaner is calculated by multiplying the airflow by the efficiency. The efficiency alone does not provide a full picture of an air cleaner’s effectiveness.</p><p>For example, many portable HEPA filters have a CADR ranging from 150 to 250 CFM. In comparison, a Corsi-Rosenthal Box (CR Box) that utilizes MERV-13 filters can have a CADR between 300 and 500 CFM. Despite the lower efficiency of the MERV-13 filters compared to HEPA filters, the CR Box is more effective and would be the preferable choice, all other factors being equal. This is because the CR Box has significantly higher airflow, compensating for the lower efficiency.</p><p>Here are some examples of misinformation regarding efficiency and effectiveness:</p><p><a href="https://www.austinair.ca/blogs/austin-air-blog/why-the-cadr-can-be-misleading">Austin Air Systems</a>: “We believe that the greatest benefit to the consumer is a higher filtration efficiency, not a faster rate of air flow”</p><p><a href="https://alen.com/pages/cadr-is-it-really-a-good-means-of-comparison">Alen</a>: “We believe a higher filtration efficiency is more important than a higher airflow rate, giving you the greatest benefit from our air purifiers.”</p><p>Both of these statements are clearly false and contradict basic physics. The steady-state concentration of pollutants is determined by their production rate and removal rate. Increasing the removal rate (which is the same as the CADR) is what truly matters, rather than focusing on filter efficiency.</p><p>However, one caveat regarding efficiency is that filters should adhere to an accepted standard. The most common standard is H13 HEPA, but MERV filters rated 11 or higher are also acceptable. Be cautious of companies that offer unrated filters under different names like “HEPA style” or “Hyper HEPA.” If a filter does not adhere to an accepted standard, it is advisable to avoid it. It’s worth noting that “Medical grade HEPA” and “True HEPA” are marketing names for H13 filters. For more information about different filter types, see <a href="https://itsairborne.com/introduction-to-air-filtration-172704a73dd4">this</a> post.</p><h3>Cost</h3><p>Effectiveness and cost are not always directly correlated when it comes to air cleaners. In many cases, expensive HEPA filters may be less effective, while reasonably priced ones can provide suitable performance. Residential HEPA filters are often just as effective as their commercial counterparts but come at a lower cost.</p><p>Additional features often contribute to an increase in cost, but they may not necessarily enhance the overall effectiveness of the air cleaner. In fact, as we will explore, these features are typically ineffective and, in some cases, may even be potentially harmful.</p><h3>UV</h3><p>UV (Ultraviolet) technology can be utilized in <a href="https://itsairborne.com/intro-to-uv-light-against-diseases-b4f0ab839a09">different ways</a> to combat airborne diseases, but in the context of portable air cleaners, it is mainly employed in two ways. The first method is germicidal UV (GUV), where pathogens are directly exposed to ultraviolet light to inactivate them. The second approach involves using a catalyst with UV to generate radicals that are released into the space, known as photocatalytic oxidation (PCO). PCO will be described in more detail in the Active Technologies section.</p><p>Some air cleaners solely rely on UV without incorporating a filter. However, there are drawbacks to these devices. They often tend to be more expensive than HEPA filters, and they do not remove other particulate matter. Fine particulate matter is the <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4409736">most harmful</a> indoor air pollutant, and HEPA filters not only provide protection against airborne diseases but also effectively reduce particulate matter. While UV-only air cleaners can be used, in my opinion, they are usually not worth it.</p><p>In many cases, portable air cleaners with HEPA filters may include UV lights as an additional feature. However, if the HEPA filter already removes 99.95% of particles from the air, the benefit of UV light would be minimal. An example highlighting this can be observed from data provided by <a href="https://www.airpura.com/products/uv600-germs-and-mold-hepa-99-97-efficient-0-3-microns">Airpura</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/601/1*rL4IqbPIyGIFRc734cFY7Q.png" /></figure><p>According to their own data, the HEPA filter achieves a 100% removal rate, rendering the UV component ineffective in terms of overall air purification.</p><p>UV can also be used to disinfect the filters, based on concerns regarding resuspension, which involves pathogens depositing on the filters and potentially getting released back into the air during filter changes or if the filter is jostled. However, the risk associated with this concern is small. Furthermore, pathogens decay and do not live that long, so even if they do get resuspended at a later date, risk from infection is very low. In the event of a known case of COVID-19 or another respiratory infection, it is advisable to wait for a day before changing the filters to allow any viruses present to decay naturally. UV disinfection is not necessary for this purpose.</p><p>In summary, incorporating UV technology in air cleaners incurs additional costs, does not provide the benefit of removing other particulate matter, and proves ineffective when combined with HEPA filters.</p><h3>Antimicrobial Coating</h3><p>There has been research conducted on the effectiveness of adding antimicrobial coatings to filters, and the findings indicate that such coatings do not provide any benefit. These studies have <a href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/full/10.1128/msphere.00086-22">shown</a> that once aerosols are captured on HEPA filters, they tend to remain attached and do not detach easily. This suggests that resuspension, the concern of virus particles being released back into the air, is not a significant issue. When a virus particle is trapped by the filter, it will typically remain there without posing a risk of being reintroduced into the environment.</p><p>Therefore, based on current research, there is no substantial advantage to incorporating antimicrobial coatings on air filters.</p><h3>Pre-Filters</h3><p>A pre-filter’s purpose is to capture larger dust particles and prevent them from clogging the HEPA filter, thereby extending its lifespan. However, incorporating a pre-filter adds extra costs for replacement. Instead, it is more practical to focus on replacing the HEPA filter when needed. In my opinion, it is not worth the investment to include a pre-filter in most portable air cleaners. Timely replacement of the HEPA filter ensures optimal performance without the added complexity and expenses of a separate pre-filter.</p><h3>Carbon Filters</h3><p>Carbon filters can remove volatile organic compounds (VOCs), ozone, and odors. They can potentially be effective if sized properly. However, air cleaners rarely provide equivalent outdoor air delivery rates for the carbon filters. They also become saturated over time and would then become ineffective. Unfortunately, many portable air cleaners do not provide clear information on the longevity and effectiveness of their carbon filters.</p><p>While carbon filters are a harmless feature, they may not necessarily deliver the desired results. Additionally, carbon filters do not remove particulate matter which includes airborne diseases. Therefore, they have no impact on addressing health concerns related to viruses or other particulate matter.</p><p>In general, when dealing with VOCs and odors, the most effective approach is through ventilation by supplying fresh outdoor air to the space.</p><p>Considering the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of carbon filters, they are not something that should be generally pursued, but should not deter you from purchasing the air purifier altogether.</p><h3>Active Technologies</h3><p><strong>Ionization, Bipolar ionization, Plasma and Plasma Wave</strong></p><p>These technologies release ions into the air. The primary mechanism of these technologies is agglomeration, where particles stick together, making them heavier and causing them to either adhere to surfaces or settle out of the air at a faster rate.</p><p><strong>Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO) or UV with catalyst</strong></p><p>PCO uses UV with a catalyst and it can create hydroxyl radicals. However, it’s important to note that PCO technology can go by various names, adding to the confusion.</p><ul><li>This<a href="https://sanuvox.com/product/sr-max/"> Sanuvox device</a> states it has a cobalt catalyst in the benefits</li><li><a href="https://www.activepure.ca/">ActivePure</a> is not very clear about how their technology works on their website, but indicate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBLTkAv5CKU">here</a> that it is PCO technology</li><li><a href="https://www.fieldcontrols.com/trio-plus-portable-air-purifier/">TrioPlus</a> uses <a href="https://www.fieldcontrols.com/pro-cell-technology/">ProCell</a> which uses an aluminum honeycomb as a catalyst for UV light.</li><li><a href="https://lasko.com/products/ac5000-3-in-1-air-cleaning-system-with-true-hepa-uv-c-sanitizer-and-odor-reduction-28-inch-tower-by-germguardian">Germ Guardian</a> “works with Titanium Dioxide to reduce volatile organic compounds”</li></ul><p>When it comes to active technologies, if a product incorporates UV with a surface or catalyst, it generally falls under the PCO category. The effects of PCO depend on the specific compounds present in the air.</p><p><strong>Other Additive Technologies</strong></p><p>Other additive technologies create compounds including hydroxyl ions, ozone, hydrogen peroxide or simply fall under the category of “active technologies.” Sometimes companies often avoid providing explicit details about their technology, which raises concerns. If it’s not clear what technology a product utilizes, it’s best to avoid it.</p><p>All these technologies have the potential to create byproducts in the air.</p><h3>Standardization of Active Technologies</h3><p>The use of any technology requires ensuring it is both safe and effective. When considering additive air cleaners like ionization, PCO, or other active technologies, it’s important to be cautious of their claims regarding virus reduction. These claims (like 99% particles reduced in one hour) can be misleading and may not reflect real-world effectiveness as described <a href="https://itsairborne.com/how-to-compare-air-cleaning-devices-819e6ed5daa3">here</a>. These claims are meaningless unless you know the size of the chamber where the experiment was performed and the percent reduction in the control test when the equipment is turned off. To determine the safety and effectiveness of air cleaners, the draft of ASHRAE 241 Appendix A provides a useful framework.</p><p>The key metric to consider is the clean air delivery rate (CADR) or equivalent outdoor air delivery rate (EOADR). This data is crucial for evaluating air cleaners accurately. The Ontario Society of Professional Engineers provides a calculator for determining the effectiveness of these systems, found <a href="http://ospe-calc.herokuapp.com/Air_Cleaners">here</a>. If manufacturers do not provide an equivalent outdoor air delivery rate, do not use their product. If they claim that their product does not work that way, then they do not understand how their product works. <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/technical%20resources/covid-19/20-31_stephens.pdf">It can be calculated</a>.</p><p>For safety, ensure that additive air cleaners comply with UL2998 standards to avoid ozone generation. Also ensure from independent tests that no additional formaldehyde or particulate matter is generated. If these tests do not exist, do not purchase it.</p><p>Once you have confirmed the effectiveness through the equivalent outdoor air delivery rate and that it produces no byproducts, you can determine if the device is cost effective compared to HEPA filters.</p><p>If you choose not to go through this process, sticking with HEPA filters is the preferable option. They provide clean air delivery rates as an easy way to ensure effectiveness and do not introduce harmful pollutants into the air. In general, I would avoid all active technologies. If you are purchasing an air cleaner that has both a HEPA filter and an active technology as an addition (like HEPA + ionization), I would disable the active component.</p><h3>Air Distribution</h3><p>Proper <a href="https://itsairborne.com/air-distribution-fans-personal-hepa-filters-plexiglass-short-range-transmission-6276cb206ec2">air distribution</a> is vital for effective air cleaner performance and risk reduction within a space. If the clean air from the air cleaner doesn’t mix well with the air in the space and simply circulates back to the intake, its effectiveness is reduced.</p><p>To ensure optimal air distribution, use fans to promote air mixing, but be cautious about creating direct currents between people. Ceiling fans are ideal for achieving proper air mixing without generating horizontal currents. The CDC has a good <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/ventilation.html">resource </a>on fan use (FAQ #11). Using HEPA filters that blow up also prevents creation of direct currents between people.</p><p>In addition, placement plays a role in air distribution. Position air cleaners away from walls or obstructions and closer to the center of the space to ensure proper mixing of clean air throughout the area.</p><h3>Human Operation</h3><p>Everyone has seen HEPA filters turned off in different spaces. A HEPA filter that is not running is entirely ineffective. While addressing noise concerns is crucial, proper labeling and educating occupants are essential to maximize the effectiveness of these devices.</p><p>To ensure the efficacy of air cleaners:</p><ol><li>Address noise-related concerns to encourage continuous operation.</li><li>Clearly label the operation instructions of air cleaners to promote awareness among occupants.</li><li>Provide appropriate training and education to occupants regarding the importance of operating the air cleaners to maintain clean and healthy indoor air.</li></ol><p>Ignoring the human operation aspect of air cleaners will lead to a failed strategy.</p><h3>Best Options &amp; Resources</h3><p>When it comes to air cleaners, the top choices are commercial HEPA filters, box fan CR boxes, and PC fan CR boxes. Each option has its own considerations, which I discuss <a href="https://itsairborne.com/box-fan-cr-box-pc-fan-cr-box-or-hepa-filter-which-one-is-right-for-you-5d0de776935c">here</a>. Personally, I prefer using PC fan CR boxes. If you’re interested in purchasing commercial HEPA filters, I recommend utilizing the <a href="https://cleanairstars.com/filters/">Clean Air Stars</a> filter selection tool. <a href="https://cleanaircrew.org/air-cleaners/">Clean Air Crew</a> also provides good resources for selecting portable air cleaners.</p><h3>Summary</h3><p>In summary, here are the key points to consider when selecting air cleaners:</p><ol><li>Determine the required clean air delivery rate (CADR) based on the size of the space and occupancy.</li><li>Choose air cleaners that meet the CADR requirements while considering the noise profile. Higher cost does not mean a better product.</li><li>Ignore features such as pre-filters, carbon filters, UV and antimicrobial coatings as they are often ineffective or unnecessary and can add cost.</li><li>Avoid additive air cleaners unless you determine the equivalent outdoor air delivery rate, confirm no increase in ozone, formaldehyde or particulate matter through independent tests and find it to be more cost-effective than HEPA filters.</li><li>Ensure proper air distribution within the space and provide clear signage and training for proper usage.</li></ol><p>By following these guidelines, you can make informed decisions when selecting air cleaners and ensure their optimal use for cleaner and healthier indoor environments.</p><p><em>I have no conflicts of interest.</em></p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=31c238bcd91f" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://itsairborne.com/how-to-pick-an-air-cleaner-31c238bcd91f">How to Pick an Air Cleaner</a> was originally published in <a href="https://itsairborne.com">It’s Airborne</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s how you can calculate it. I’ll be using the following abbreviations in this post:</p><p>AC — air changes<br>ACH — air changes per hour<br>ft³ — room volume in cubic feet<br>m³ — room volume in cubic meters<br>CFM — air flow rate in cubic feet per minute<br>lps — air flow rate in liters per second <br>m³/h — air flow rate in m³ per hour<br>CADR — clean air delivery rate, either in CFM, lps or m³/h</p><h3>Empty Room Transmission</h3><p>Airborne transmission primarily occurs indoors when in short range or when sharing a room with an infectious person. However, when an infectious person is in a room, respiratory particles they have exhaled can fill the room. If they leave and shortly after a susceptible person enters that room, they could still inhale a high dose of those particles and can get infected. Although this is not the most common mode of transmission, it is still a risk and cleaning the air in the space after they have left can mitigate this mode of transmission. It’s called flushing the space.</p><h3>How Quickly Does Flushing Remove Virus?</h3><p><strong>Air Changes (AC)</strong><br>As explained in this <a href="https://itsairborne.com/how-to-compare-air-cleaning-devices-819e6ed5daa3#2e68">post</a>, every time you change the air in the space, there is a 63% reduction in the pollutant. The formula for total reduction of virus particles is:</p><p>% Virus Removed = 1-e^-(AC) (EQ-1)</p><p>For example, after 3 air changes, virus removed = 1-e^-3 = 95%</p><p><strong>Air Changes per Hour (ACH)<br></strong>The rate that the ventilation or filtration system can flush the air in a room is usually measured in air changes per hour or ACH which can be calculated as follows:</p><p>ACH = Clean air delivery rate x unit conversions / room volume (EQ-2) Where: <br>Room volume is in ft³ or m³ calculated as length x width x height<br>If CADR is in cubic feet per minute (CFM), the unit conversion is 60 minutes per hour.<br>If CADR is in liters per second (lps), the unit conversion is 3.6 m³/h per lps.</p><p>Example: HEPA filter with a CADR of 200 CFM in a room that is 12 ft x 12 ft x 8 ft. What is the ACH?</p><p>ACH = 200 x 60 / (12x12x8)=10.4 ACH</p><h3>How Much Flushing is Required?</h3><p>The guidance from the <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/technical%20resources/covid-19/ashrae-building-readiness.pdf">ASHRAE Epidemic Task Force</a> indicates 3 air changes are required between occupied periods.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*7bw4w1vyhmCgYT_0FJtsHQ.png" /></figure><p>ASHRAE has also released a draft for standard 241 to control infectious aerosols. The draft also requires 3 air changes between occupancies.</p><p>The position of the CDC on their <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/ventilation.html">ventilation webpage</a> is as follows:</p><ul><li>In general, flush for 3 air changes.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/950/1*GroSCERED-NffqBRELsJtA.png" /></figure><ul><li>In healthcare settings or places where an infectious person is known to have been present, flush the space for 5 air changes to have a 99% particle reduction.</li><li>If there is a suspected case of measles, flush the space for 7 air changes to have a 99.9% reduction.</li></ul><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/948/1*5ksb1OtPIqpW2QTMBKbslg.png" /></figure><p>It appears to be a general consensus to flush the space for 3 air changes post occupancy in most settings. A more conservative value would be for 5 air changes or 99% reduction in virus concentration which the CDC recommends when there is a known case of an airborne disease or in healthcare settings. There also appears to be a consensus that in the absence of known air change rate from the ventilation system, assume a rate of 1.5 air changes per hour (ACH) and run the ventilation system for 2 hours after occupancy.</p><h3>Calculating Flushing Time</h3><p><strong>Filtration<br></strong>For portable air cleaning devices like portable HEPA filters, the clean air delivery rate should be provided by the manufacturer. When using high efficiency filters in an air handling unit, the clean air delivery rate can be calculated as the efficiency x the rate of recirculated air. An engineer or qualified professional would need to tell you the rate of recirculated air. The efficiency is given in ASHRAE 241P, Appendix A:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/337/1*tzQLTZw9PPGzEgDzWaJdSw.png" /></figure><p><strong>Ventilation<br></strong>For mechanical ventilation rates, either an engineer or qualified professional can determine the outdoor air flow rate. Using windows does not produce a reliable level of ventilation which can vary greatly, so CO2 would ideally be used a gauge of the ventilation (see below).</p><p>Example: A classroom that is 30 ft x 30 ft x 9 ft has 250 CFM of outdoor air and 750 CFM of recirculated air with MERV-11 filters (60% efficiency). What is the air change rate? Using EQ-2:</p><p>ACH = CADR x 60/volume = (250 + 750 x 0.6) x 60/ (30 x 30 x 9) = 5.2 ACH</p><p><strong>Calculate 3 Air Changes</strong></p><p>Once you know the air changes per hour in the room, calculating three air changes is simple:</p><p>Time (hours) = # air changes / ACH<br>Time (minutes) = # air changes x 60 / ACH (EQ-3)</p><p>So if you have a room with 5 ACH and want to know how long to flush to achieve 3 air changes:</p><p>Time = 3 x 60/5 ACH = 36 minutes</p><p><strong>CO2 — Calculating ACH</strong></p><p>An alternative method is to measure the CO2 decay rate when everyone leaves the room. This assumes there is no CO2 generation in the room, either by people or though combustion. As explained <a href="https://schools.forhealth.org/ventilation-guide/">here</a>, you can use the following formula to determine the air changes per hour:</p><p>ACH = -1 x ln ((final CO2–420)/(initial CO2–420))/ time (in hours) (EQ-4)</p><p>For example, CO2 now is 1200 ppm. It initially was 1500 ppm and it took 20 minutes (20/60 = 0.33 hours). How many air changes per hour is the ventilation in the room?</p><p>ACH = -1 x ln ((1200–420)/(1500–420))/0.33 = 1 ACH</p><p><strong>CO2 — Calculating Air Changes</strong></p><p>An even easier way to use CO2 is to just measure the air changes by the pollutant decrease. The difference between the indoor and outdoor CO2 decreases by 63% with each air change, so 3 air changes gets you to 95% decrease (5% remaining):</p><p>Final indoor CO2 = (Initial Indoor CO2 — Outdoor CO2) x 0.05 + Outdoor CO2<br>Final indoor CO2 = 0.05 Initial Indoor CO2 + 0.95 Outdoor CO2 (EQ-5)</p><p>So if the CO2 starts at 1200 ppm, outdoor CO2 is 420 ppm and you open the windows, there will be 3 air changes once the CO2 is:</p><p>Final Indoor CO2 = 0.05 x 1200+0.95 x 420 = 460 ppm</p><p><strong>Absolute CO2 Levels</strong></p><p>The truth is, percent reduction of a pollutant from an initial level is not the correct method of determining the risk of a space. The correct method is based on the concentration of the pollutant. If a space initially has a lower concentration of a pollutant, it will require a lower reduction in concentration to achieve the same level of risk as a space with a higher initial concentration. One method would be to pick a low CO2 level which would correspond to a very low level of rebreathed air. For example, if CO2 is below 500 ppm, you can assume that the space is very low risk. For reference, a steady state CO2 concentration of 500 ppm equates to approximately 60 liters per second per person, where ASHRAE 241 rates for control of infectious aerosols range between 10–40 liters per second per person in non-healthcare settings.</p><p><strong>Air Mixing</strong></p><p>One problem is that air might not be properly mixed throughout the space. If you are using a HEPA filter to flush the space, it might just be cleaning the air next to it and not properly cleaning the whole space. The CDC warns about this issue on their <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/ventilation.html">ventilation page</a>. The easiest solution to ensure the air is properly mixed throughout the space would be to use a fan to circulate the air around the room. Placing HEPA filters in the middle of the room will also help.</p><h3>When Flushing is not Required</h3><p>The 3 air changes can be provided through ventilation or filtration, but they can also occur naturally through three processes:</p><p><strong>Decay<br></strong>Virus particles naturally decay over time and the rate often depends on temperature and humidity. With SARS-CoV-2, here are some values for the ACH due to decay:</p><ul><li>Based on <a href="https://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology/sars-airborne-calculator">DHS</a>, half-life in most normal conditions is less than 2 hours. If it was 2 hours, that would be 0.4 ACH</li><li>This <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16K1OQkLD4BjgBdO8ePj6ytf-RpPMlJ6aXFg3PrIQBbQ/edit#gid=519189277">calculator</a> on line 330 estimates decay at 0.2 to 0.6 ACH</li><li>This <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmc2004973">publication</a> found 0.6 ACH for decay</li></ul><p>Overall, an estimate of 0.4 ACH for decay is a reasonable value.</p><p><strong>Deposition</strong><br>Just like dust, particles can land on surfaces instead of remaining airborne. Once they land on a surface, you cannot inhale them and they pose no risk of airborne transmission, unless they are resuspended into the air. Deposition rates depend on particle size and other factors in the space. Some typical rates for deposition are <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16K1OQkLD4BjgBdO8ePj6ytf-RpPMlJ6aXFg3PrIQBbQ/edit#gid=519189277">0.2 to 2 ACH</a> (line 357) and it is estimated at 0.4 ACH.</p><p><strong>Infiltration</strong><br>Buildings are not air-tight. Air leaks in and out of the building, even if the ventilation is off and the doors and windows are closed. Typical values for infiltration are between 0.2 to 2 ACH, depending on how tight the building is.</p><p>Putting these together, it is reasonable to assume that combining infiltration, decay and deposition, the total natural air change rate will be greater than 0.5 ACH. This means that after 6 hours, the building will have 3 air changes without requiring any active flushing. Both the <a href="https://ospe.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Safer_Indoor_Air_Nov22_Final.pdf">Ontario Society of Professional Engineers</a> and ASHRAE 241 Draft state that if there is more than 6 hours between occupancies (like overnight), flushing the space is not required. This is important as running equipment for extra hours can have significant energy costs and if it provides little to no benefit, we should reduce energy consumption and spend our resources on more effective methods, like increasing the clean air delivery rate while the room is occupied.</p><h3>Summary</h3><ul><li>Flush spaces after occupancy for 3 air changes in most settings. Use 5 air changes if an infectious person was known to be present or in medical settings.</li><li>Find the air changes per hour from ventilation and filtration. Time to flush (minutes) = # air changes x 60 / ACH</li><li>If HVAC rates are not known, flush for 2 hours</li><li>If the space will be unoccupied for 6 or more hours, flushing is not required</li><li>Ensure the air is well mixed in the space when flushing</li></ul><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=222c3717665b" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://itsairborne.com/flushing-spaces-after-occupancy-222c3717665b">Flushing Spaces After Occupancy</a> was originally published in <a href="https://itsairborne.com">It’s Airborne</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Air Distribution — Fans, Personal HEPA Filters, Plexiglass &amp; Short Range Transmission</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*5kerRzJ9XQSKpFTbm_DBNg.png" /><figcaption>Image by <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/3d-rendering-ventilation-system_22894125.htm#query=ducts%20ceiling&amp;position=8&amp;from_view=search&amp;track=ais">Freepik</a></figcaption></figure><p>A lack of understanding of air distribution is a major source of misinformation and bad decisions about ventilation. In order to create low risk environments and ensure our interventions are effective, addressing air distribution is an essential part of the plan which is often neglected.</p><h3>What is air distribution?</h3><p>You can supply clean air to a space, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that people will be breathing it in. It’s possible the air will never make it into their breathing zone. Air distribution deals with how well that clean air is supplied throughout the space. It can also refer to issues of dead-spots — places within the zone where the air is not well mixed and the concentration of pollutants is higher.</p><h3>Causes of poor air distribution</h3><p>While there are different types of air distribution systems, the vast majority are mixing ventilation systems and consequently, I will be dealing with mixing ventilation systems in this post. The goal is for all the clean air and pollutants to be evenly distributed throughout the space. If this doesn’t happen, the concentration of pollutants will be higher in some parts of the space and they will pose an increased risk to anyone located there. When it comes to supplying air to the room, there is an issue called short-circuiting where air being supplied goes straight to the return without mixing into the space.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/478/1*f3ZGLZQvIOC-O-F2_qWx1w.png" /><figcaption>An example of short-circuiting. Cleaner air remains in the upper part of the room and travels straight from the supply diffuser to the exhaust grille and does not mix into the room. The occupant will be exposed to higher concentrations of pollutants since they are not properly diluted with the clean air. Image from <a href="https://www.simscale.com/blog/displacement-ventilation-cfd/">Simscale</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>The risk of short circuiting is based on how the system is designed and operated. ASHRAE 62.1, the standard for ventilation and air quality, quantifies how much short-circuiting can occur based on the different types of system designs and operations. Here’s table 6-4 for zone distribution effectiveness.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/928/1*uxp9nE4p5it-V-ryFiyWMA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Zone air distribution effectiveness. The left side describes the situation. The right column shows Ez which is how effective the air distribution will be. Ideally, for mixed ventilation systems, Ez should be 1. Ez of 0.8 means that the ventilation is only 80% as effective.</figcaption></figure><p>The most common problem is #3, supplying hot air at the ceiling. Warm air will be buoyant and remain in the upper part of the room and won’t mix into the lower part of the room (breathing zone). It reduces air distribution by 20%.</p><p>The most egregious distribution problem is #9 — supply and return on the same side of the room. It’s common and a complete engineering design failure. Here’s what it would look like.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ap39Y_L-C0Y49nWOguUq7Q.jpeg" /></figure><p>The exhaust and supply are right beside each other. Imagine being on the other side of the room. How helpful would this be? How much would the unit just clean the air beside it and not have much of an effect on the whole space? Based on #9 in ASHRAE table 6.1, the assumption is that it’s only 50% effective on the space as a whole, so if it is supplying 400 cubic feet per minute (CFM) of air to the space, it is only as effective as a unit that would be supplying 200 CFM with proper air distribution ductwork and diffusers. Ignoring air distribution is a way to cut corners when installing new ventilation systems. It can save money on the installation, but significantly hamper the effectiveness of the ventilation.</p><h3>Calculating air distribution</h3><p>This section requires math. It helps conceptualize the issues at hand. Understanding the math is not essential to understand these concepts. You can skip to the next section.</p><p>ASHRAE 62.1 Appendix C provides an equation to calculate the air distribution effectiveness throughout the space. It can be calculated as:</p><p>Distribution Effectiveness = (Ce-Cs)/(C-Cs)<br>Where:<br>Ce is the concentration of a pollutant in the exhaust air<br>Cs is the concentration of a pollutant in the supply air<br>C is the concentration of a pollutant in the space</p><p>Here are some examples.</p><p>If all the air from the supply goes straight into the exhaust and there is no mixing into the space, then Ce = Cs and the distribution effectiveness = 0. This will never exist as there will always be some mixing.</p><p>If the space is perfectly mixed, then the concentration of the pollutants in the exhaust will be the same as the concentration of pollutants in the space or Ce = C. The equation will then be (C-Cs)/(C-Cs) = 1. Therefore, perfect air distribution in mixing ventilation systems has the same pollutant concentration in the exhaust as the space and should have uniform pollutant concentration throughout the space.</p><p>Here’s an example with numbers. You are supplying 100% outdoor air to the space with a carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration of 420 parts per million (ppm). You measure the CO2 concentration in the space at 1200 ppm and the CO2 in the exhaust at 900 ppm. What’s the air distribution effectiveness?</p><p>Distribution effectiveness = (900–420)/(1200–420)=0.62</p><p>Therefore, the ventilation supplied to the space is only 62% effective. This is a huge waste. 38% of the air which you are already using up energy to get into the space is not making it to people’s noses, but instead going straight into the return and bypassing everyone. What would happen here if you designed the space better to ensure proper distribution?</p><p>I won’t derive the CO2 equations again, but you can find the equations <a href="https://itsairborne.com/intro-to-monitoring-co2-20f191dd8f60">here</a>.</p><p>For a classroom at 1200 ppm,<br>Outdoor airflow rate per person = (0.0045 lps x 1000000)/(1200–420)=5.8 lps /person, where lps = litres per second. <br>For a classroom at 900 ppm, <br>Outdoor airflow rate per person = (0.0045 lps x 1000000)/(900–420)=9.4 lps /person</p><p>What’s the actual outdoor airflow rate per person supplied to the space?<br>5.8 x 0.62 + 9.4 x 0.38 = 7.2 lps/person.</p><p>If there was perfect distribution, the CO2 level would be:<br>Indoor CO2 = 420 ppm + (0.0045 lps × 1 000 000) / 7.2 lps/person = 1045 ppm</p><p>Therefore, the occupants will be exposed to CO2 levels around 200 ppm higher than what would be expected in a properly designed space with no added energy cost.</p><h3>Diagnosing air distribution problems</h3><p>A proper diagnosis of air distribution problems requires measuring the pollutants in the space. To know if it’s air distribution and not just poor ventilation, you need to compare the pollutant in the space and the air that is being exhausted from the space. Therefore, verifying the ventilation equipment is operating properly does not necessarily identify air distribution issues. There are three main options to identify air distribution issues.</p><p><strong>CO2 monitoring</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/726/1*PU6fPC-FO2mI5FkPuohBJg.png" /></figure><p>CO2 monitoring is one of the best tools to ensure ventilation is working properly. Measuring the CO2 in the space will tell you how well outdoor air is being supplied to the space. If you measure the CO2 in the return duct, or if the CO2 concentrations are much higher than expected and the equipment is working properly, it can indicate an air distribution issue. A full introduction to CO2 monitoring can be found <a href="https://itsairborne.com/intro-to-monitoring-co2-20f191dd8f60">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Pollutant decay</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/658/1*ZZVJ449UwoA2ahv2MEMGzg.png" /><figcaption>Dry ice being used in a classroom to increase the CO2 concentration to measure the decay.</figcaption></figure><p>First, a pollutant is placed into the space and the concentration increases. Then you remove the pollutant from the space and measure how quickly the pollutant is removed. This can be done with dry ice and CO2 sensors. It is explained <a href="https://t.co/miuiQTndlv">here</a> on page 16.</p><p><strong>Fog study</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fEb6hkhwjHiBqTKLdNcjtw.png" /><figcaption><a href="https://twitter.com/NHKWORLD_News/status/1277949657491165184">https://twitter.com/NHKWORLD_News/status/1277949657491165184</a></figcaption></figure><p>The previous two methods can identify how well the air is distributed from the ventilation system to a location within the breathing zone. Unless you measure at many points throughout the space, which is generally impractical, it doesn’t give you a complete picture. A fog study can be used to see how well the fog is cleared from the whole space. This is the best way to identify dead-spots, where the ventilation is not properly removing pollutants.</p><h3>Improving air distribution</h3><p>The simplest way to improve air distribution is a fan. It will help mix the air throughout the space and ensure the pollutant concentration and clean air supply is uniform. Pedestal fans can be used for this, but you should avoid creating direct currents between people. Having it move air vertically can help mix the dirtier air in the breathing zone with the cleaner air in the upper room. A ceiling fan is ideal for this purpose and should be used. This can also be used when a fog study identifies dead-spots in the room. The CDC recommends using fans <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/ventilation.html">here</a> FAQ 9. The ASHRAE Epidemic Task Force recommends mixing the air in the space as their third <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/technical%20resources/covid-19/core-recommendations-for-reducing-airborne-infectious-aerosol-exposure.pdf">core recommendation</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XrTjvU2GPIDmMDykxATvBQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>A <a href="https://bigassfans.com/ca/i6/">ceiling fan</a> can help mix the air in the space and ensure proper air distribution.</figcaption></figure><p>Addressing the issues previously shown in ASHRAE 62.1 Table 6–4 can also improve air distribution. Systems should never be designed with the supply and the return on the same side of the room. Ideally, have a proper air distribution system designed and if not, at least place them on opposite sides of the room (see table 6–4 #8). It takes the ventilation from being 50% effective and makes it 80% effective.</p><p>For systems where the air is being supplied from the ceiling, it’s common for equipment to just supply really hot air to the space. Trying to reduce the temperature as much as comfortably allowable will help the air mix into the lower room instead of remaining buoyant in the upper room. Ventilation equipment which tightly controls the air temperature can help with this.</p><h3>Short range transmission and air currents</h3><p>There is a higher risk of transmission of airborne diseases when a susceptible person is in short-range from an infector. This is because the initial exhaled plume has a higher concentration of virus particles.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*D5-M--sMR0PemG5VuIbzqA.jpeg" /></figure><p>The issue can also be rephrased this way — risk is increased because a person is located within the space in a room that has a higher virus concentration. Seen in this light, short range transmission is just an air distribution issue. The way to mitigate short range transmission is to try to quickly make the virus concentration at short range similar to the virus concentration in the room. For example, a ceiling fan above the people at short range will quickly push the aerosols out of the breathing zone and mix it into the rest of the room.</p><p>A concern can exist when creating air currents from one person to another. This higher concentration of virus particles can be pushed towards someone who is not at short range. Pedestal fans can help with air distribution, but can also create air currents when not setup properly. The best way to mitigate this is to avoid creating direct currents between people. Aiming fans up or not directly at people will help reduce the risk. If it is aimed towards someone stationary, like in an office or classroom, it should be kept two meter away. This concern should not exist for ceiling fans or properly designed air distribution systems.</p><p>A misconception is that you are creating an increased risk for everyone in the room by doing this. It’s based on ignorance and thinking that these viruses won’t travel throughout the room without a fan. For example, the Health Agency of Canada <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/covid-19-improving-indoor-ventilation.html#a2b">claims</a> fans “make the virus travel further”. In general, air eventually mixes throughout the room. Using a fan, even in this case, will not change the steady state concentration of viruses in the room. It will just ensure that they are more uniform, thereby reducing risk associated with places that are higher concentration and ensure that the clean air supplied is properly mixed into the space.</p><p>In general, using a fan or having better air distribution will not increase risk, but will lower risk by ensuring the clean air is better mixed throughout the space and ensuring there are no spaces with a higher virus concentration.</p><h3>HEPA filters &amp; blowing the virus around</h3><p>HEPA filters are just a fan with a filter. The fan will draw air through the filter and the filter will remove particulate matter from the air, including virus laden respiratory aerosols. The fan then operates just as any other fan would. Consequently, a HEPA filter can also be seen as a method to improve air distribution.</p><p>A common repeated misconception is that they blow the virus around, but this is the same as previously discussed. The virus is already travelling around the room. The fan with the HEPA filter will just assist in ensuring that the clean air supplied is better mixed throughout the space and that there are fewer locations with higher concentrations of virus. This is in addition to the cleaner air that it supplies to the space. Overall, HEPA filters reduce risk even though their use has been prevented by public health organizations due to their ignorance about air distribution.</p><p>HEPA filters can be seen as working with the ventilation system to mix the air in the space. However, alone by themselves, they are unlikely to mix the air will into the space. Going back to table 6–4, HEPA filters are the case where the supply and return are on the same side of the room (they are actually right beside each other). This means according to 62.1, you can assume they are about 50% effective, so a HEPA filter supplying 200 cubic feet per minute (CFM) of clean air is similar to a well-distributed ventilation system supplying 100 CFM of clean air throughout the space.</p><p>Sometimes HEPA filters can help clean the air throughout the room, but sometimes they would just make the air in the corner of the room a little cleaner while being ineffective at greater distances. The solution is to ensure the air is properly distributed throughout the room with the use of fans or a functioning ventilation system.</p><h3>Personal HEPA Filters and airplane air outlets</h3><p>The goal with personal HEPA filters is to take advantage of poor air distribution and create a zone of lower virus concentration. If the air coming out of the filter does not mix that well into the space, then the air in the vicinity will be cleaner. <a href="https://twitter.com/CleanAirStars">Clean Air Stars</a> has tested this out with various models, for example, this is what they found with the QT3.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*g4Mf-LSUxzgvjdjjBOq5bA.jpeg" /></figure><p>Within 1 m, there is a reduction in particle concentration. It’s more effective within 40 cm, but that would be uncomfortable to do this for an extended period of time. In general, unless you are holding it close to your face and blowing at you, we don’t have evidence that personal HEPA filters are effective.</p><p>If you are using a large HEPA filter, it will likely create an area closer to it with lower particle concentrations as they do not have great air distribution by themselves. Some people are concerned that HEPA filters will draw the virus towards you, but because of short circuiting, the opposite would likely be true. Air closer to the HEPA filter will have a higher concentration of clean air and be lower risk than the rest of the space. The air that would be brought towards the HEPA filter would be mixed air from the space, so the worst case scenario, being near the HEPA filter would be the same risk as being away from the HEPA filter.</p><p>Personal air outlets (gaspers) on airplanes are also an example of clean air being supplied. In general, the air mixes quickly into the space and they do not provide much protection. <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/technical%20resources/covid-19/ashrae-transportation-c19-guidance.pdf">Guidance</a> from the ASHRAE epidemic task force is that their use is not necessarily recommended, but not discouraged.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/796/1*NhAUyEv8_d_CHoPDlExUXQ.png" /></figure><h3>Plexiglass barriers</h3><p>Any barriers in a space can interfere with air distribution. They create eddies which can trap particles and prevent them from being cleared out of the space.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/980/1*Px3mb9cefdv97wFNng8DWQ.jpeg" /><figcaption><a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/RA/C4RA14792H">https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2015/RA/C4RA14792H</a></figcaption></figure><p>Desk shields were a tool that were used in schools at the beginning of the pandemic based on ignorance of air distribution and the flawed assumption that large droplet spray poses a higher risk than airborne aerosols. Consequently, the desk shields increased the risk of transmission.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*sXVKq34kuKdeu6iyfNz9YQ.jpeg" /><figcaption><a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh2939">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abh2939</a></figcaption></figure><p>Barriers on the one hand can be used to mitigate short range transmission by preventing inhalation of the initial concentrated plume. However, they also increase risk from shared room transmission by inhibiting air distribution. In my opinion, for situations where there are many short range interactions, like receptionists or grocery checkout personnel, plexiglass barriers can be used provided there are portable air cleaners used close to the employee or if a fog study is done to confirm that general air distribution isn’t hampered. For situations like office space and classrooms, plexiglass barriers increase risk of transmission.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Much of the focus in guidance is simply dealing with clean air delivery rates, but is not as focused on how the air moves throughout the space. Failure in understanding air distribution has lead to bad guidance and poor decisions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, including reluctance to use fans, prohibitions on HEPA filters, use of plexiglass barriers, poor HVAC installations ignoring air distribution and leaving air distribution improvements out of guidance.</p><p>Providing clean air to a space requires either ventilation, filtration or UV light. While air distribution alone does not provide a low risk space, it’s an essential component to ensure the air cleaning measures are effective.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=6276cb206ec2" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://itsairborne.com/air-distribution-fans-personal-hepa-filters-plexiglass-short-range-transmission-6276cb206ec2">Air Distribution — Fans, Personal HEPA Filters, Plexiglass &amp; Short Range Transmission</a> was originally published in <a href="https://itsairborne.com">It’s Airborne</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s a full rundown on what it is, how it works, how to check it, common problems and how to improve it.</p><h3>What is ventilation and why is it needed?</h3><p>Ventilation is the process of moving air into and out of a space and typically refers to supplying outdoor air.</p><p>The air quality inside buildings can be poor because of harmful airborne pollutants, which can have negative impacts on the health and comfort of occupants. Indoor pollutant concentrations are often higher than those found outdoors, making it crucial to reduce their concentration to maintain healthy indoor air quality.</p><p>The most straightforward way to reduce indoor pollutant concentrations is by exhausting indoor air and replacing it with outdoor air. However, this approach can be problematic if outdoor air is heavily polluted. In such cases, filtration can be used to address outdoor air pollution, but it is only effective in removing particulate matter. Ultraviolet (UV) light can help eliminate microbes, but it is not effective against all indoor air pollutants.</p><p>In commercial settings, ventilation is often the only method used to maintain adequate indoor air quality. Thus, ensuring adequate ventilation is crucial for protecting the health of occupants.</p><h3>Health Effects</h3><p>Inhaling high concentrations of indoor air pollutants can have severe health effects over time. However, by ensuring that outdoor air is supplied to indoor spaces, these health effects can be mitigated. Studies have documented improvements in cognitive function, respiratory problems, and fewer sick days when ventilation rates are increased. This is a good summary of the research for this on schools.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_w2NsRXtAkgIU70t_qNlbw.png" /><figcaption>Designing infectious disease resilience into school buildings through improvements to ventilation and air cleaning from The Lancet COVID-19 Commission Task Force on Safe Work, Safe School and Safe Travel.

For example, nail salons with high levels of volatile organic compounds (toxic gases released from the beauty products) would require high ventilation rates. Gyms, where people sweat and smell, would also require higher rates than places where people are not engaging in those activities, like a library. These rates are codified in building codes. These codes usually reference a ventilation standard. The most commonly referenced one is ASHRAE 62.1. The required ventilation rates change depending on the type of space, the size of the space and the amount of people. Often values end up being 2–3 air changes per hour or 4–8 litres/second/person).</p><p>If your concern is mitigating the spread of airborne diseases like COVID-19, ventilation is important, but filtration or UV can be equally effective. I deal with how much is required <a href="https://itsairborne.com/air-changes-per-hour-flow-per-person-flow-per-area-what-is-the-right-metric-for-clean-air-a7e972ea4999">here</a>.</p><h3>Types of ventilation</h3><p>Ventilation can be classified into three categories: natural, mechanical and hybrid.</p><p>Natural ventilation refers to air that enters a building through openings, such as windows, doors, and vents, without the use of fans to supply the air. Temperature differences, wind, and buoyancy determine the rate of airflow in natural ventilation systems. Uncontrolled natural ventilation, also called infiltration, occurs when air leaks into a building through the building envelope. Natural ventilation is typically more energy-efficient since fans are not required to ventilate a space. However, because the airflow is not well controlled, it can often lead to insufficient ventilation rates. Additionally, since air is not filtered or tempered, high natural ventilation rates can be problematic in areas with air pollution or very cold outdoor temperatures. Many old natural ventilation buildings were designed with very low ventilation rates.</p><p>Mechanical ventilation, on the other hand, uses fans to control the amount of air supplied to the building. The most significant advantages of mechanical ventilation are that the amount of air supplied to the space is controlled, the air is filtered, and the temperature can be adjusted to ensure that it is comfortable. Heat recovery can also be used to save energy where heat from the air that is exhausted is transferred to the outdoor air that will be supplied to the space. Although mechanical ventilation is generally more expensive to install, operate, and maintain, it provides a more reliable ventilation rate to ensure acceptable indoor air quality.</p><p>Hybrid ventilation refers to a variety of methods used to manage air circulation in buildings, which can differ in their implementation. One type of hybrid ventilation simply refers to mechanical ventilation in buildings with operable windows, allowing occupants to adjust air supply. Another type of hybrid ventilation involves switching between mechanical and natural ventilation based on weather conditions. A third type, known as exhaust-driven natural ventilation or exhaust-only ventilation, employs forced infiltration through the use of exhaust fans to continuously exhaust air from each room, creating negative pressure that draws in outdoor air through openings. Older exhaust-only systems often have low airflow rates, which leads to poor indoor air quality.</p><h3>Mechanical Ventilation Equipment</h3><p>Mechanical ventilation equipment serves several functions in supplying air to a space. First and foremost, it facilitates ventilation by bringing in outdoor air. Additionally, the air can be adjusted for temperature and humidity, collectively known as climate control, to ensure optimal comfort levels. Recirculating air for climate control is also an option, eliminating the need to rely solely on outdoor air.</p><p>A typical air handling unit (AHU) is a common mechanical ventilation system used in commercial buildings. The AHU is composed of a series of components, including filters, heating or cooling coils, and a fan. The system operates by mixing outdoor air and recirculated air from the building through dampers that control the amount of air from each source. The mixed air is then filtered, heated or cooled to the desired temperature and humidity, and supplied to the space.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*Xth16_QenckOTTexSbuv7g.png" /><figcaption><a href="https://mepfzone.blogspot.com/2021/05/working-of-ahu-air-handling-unit.html">https://mepfzone.blogspot.com/2021/05/working-of-ahu-air-handling-unit.html</a></figcaption></figure><p>Another mechanical ventilation system is the unit ventilator. It is a wall-mounted unit that supplies outdoor air to the space through an opening in the wall. The unit ventilator typically contains a fan, filters, and heating or cooling components, allowing it to adjust the temperature of the supplied air.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/840/1*Ik2AnMplMfIp9zyN0asz0Q.png" /><figcaption>People checking the air coming out of a unit ventilator. <a href="https://ny.chalkbeat.org/2020/8/26/21403495/tissue-paper-test-ventilation-nyc-schools">https://ny.chalkbeat.org/2020/8/26/21403495/tissue-paper-test-ventilation-nyc-schools</a></figcaption></figure><h3>The Packaged Rooftop Unit</h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*_OhcBTntPv61XJqVC3QlXQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Picture of 3 rooftop units. <a href="https://simplifiedsafety.com/blog/hvac-rooftop-safety/">https://simplifiedsafety.com/blog/hvac-rooftop-safety/</a></figcaption></figure><p>If you are located in a strip mall or a small building, the ventilation equipment is likely a packaged rooftop unit (RTU). The RTU is a cheap air handling unit that has dampers, filters, heating, cooling and a fan, just like a typical air handling unit. A significant issue is that it usually does not carefully control the supply air temperature which means it is limited in how much outdoor air it can supply to a space, or it will supply very cold air in the winter. Usually it can only supply around 20% outdoor air, when minimum requirements are often closer to 35%. RTUs are often controlled by thermostats. The fan setting should always be ‘on’ when the space is occupied and left in ‘auto’ when unoccupied. Because it is located outdoors, the equipment is exposed to the elements and dampers often fail and are left broken. If it is controlled by a thermostat, there is no monitoring to ensure the dampers are working properly or outdoor air is being supplied to the space. Contractors who are responsible for maintaining the units would be the ones to diagnose this, but it is usually ignored. These units are usually lower quality and have difficulty handling MERV-13 filters.</p><h3>HVAC System Classifications</h3><p><strong>Ventilation &amp; Climate Control vs. Ventilation Only</strong></p><p>Supplied air in HVAC systems serves two primary purposes: ventilation and climate control. In cases where climate control is already in place in each room, such as with perimeter radiators, only outdoor air is required for ventilation. However, when air is needed for both ventilation and climate control, recirculated air is used. For example, if a space requires 100 cubic feet per minute (CFM) of outdoor air for ventilation and a total of 200 CFM of hot air to maintain warmth during the winter, 100 CFM of return air can be used. Dampers are used to control the amount of return air, and in this case, the dampers will be open to 50% return air and 50% outdoor air. If a space gets too cold at night, the HVAC unit can turn on to keep it warmer and only use recirculated air (0% outdoor air) since it would be wasteful to provide outdoor air to an empty building.</p><p><strong>100% Outdoor Air vs. Recirculated Air</strong></p><p>Some air handling units only supply outdoor air and have no recirculated air. These units are often called Makeup Air Units (MAUs) and are generally used for ventilation-only systems. As previously mentioned, HVAC systems that are designed for ventilation and temperature control use recirculated air. Dampers can modulate to determine how much outdoor air is supplied to the space. These systems can employ a strategy called demand control ventilation, where the amount of outdoor air supplied to the space is adjusted based on the number of people in the space. As the number of people decreases, less air can be supplied to the space, saving energy. Systems with recirculated air ensure that the air supplied to the space isn’t too hot or too cold by mixing outdoor air with recirculated air before resupplying it. These systems also have an economizer mode or free cooling mode, where extra outdoor air can be supplied to the space to cool it down when it is cool outside and hot inside. This is also known as free cooling.</p><p><strong>Constant Volume vs. Variable Volume</strong></p><p>Most older HVAC systems are constant volume, meaning the amount of air supplied to the space remains constant. Many modern HVAC systems, however, are designed to be variable volume, meaning the amount of air supplied to the space varies. A minimum amount of air should be maintained for ventilation, and extra air can be added if heating or cooling is necessary. By reducing the amount of air supplied to the space, energy can be saved.</p><p><strong>Mixing vs. UFAD vs. Displacement ventilation</strong></p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*i0xi9qaAQYulmbluem6xfQ.png" /><figcaption>Different types of ventilation systems and the concentration of airborne contaminants. Source: ASHRAE Journal, Vol. 64, no. 12, December 2022</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Mixing ventilation:</strong> This is the most common type of ventilation system where air is supplied from diffusers located on the ceiling or high up on the wall. The supplied air mixes with the room air and creates a relatively uniform concentration of contaminants throughout the space.</p><p><strong>Underfloor air distribution (UFAD):</strong> In this system, air is supplied from the floor and extracted from the ceiling. The supply air pushes contaminants upwards towards the ceiling where they can be extracted. UFAD systems can be more energy-efficient than mixing ventilation systems, but they require a raised floor system to accommodate the ductwork.</p><p><strong>Displacement ventilation:</strong> This type of system is even more effective in removing contaminants and preventing air from being shared between occupants. The cool supply air is supplied near the floor and spreads out across the floor. As it heats up, it rises to the ceiling where it is extracted, creating a gentle upward airflow. The use of fans or HEPA filters in the space can create cross-currents, which can disrupt the upward airflow in displacement ventilation systems. However, these systems are not as common as mixing systems.</p><h3>Air distribution</h3><p>Air distribution measures how much of the air from the air handling unit makes it to the breathing zones of building occupants. Several factors can prevent this clean air from reaching its intended destination.</p><p>One factor is ductwork problems. After leaving the air handling unit, the air must travel through ductwork to reach the various rooms and spaces of the building. Ductwork can become damaged, leaky, or separated over time, causing air to be lost or diverted away from its intended destination. This can result in insufficient ventilation reaching certain areas of the building.</p><p>Another possible air distribution issue occurs when supplying multiple zones. When an air handling unit supplies air to multiple spaces, it is crucial to ensure that each space receives the appropriate amount of air. In newer installations, manual balancing dampers can be adjusted to ensure the correct amount of air is supplied to each zone. However, in older buildings, these manual dampers may not have been installed or may have shifted over time, leading to inconsistent air distribution throughout the building. Zones closer to the air handling unit could have high airflow rates while zones further away could have very low airflow rates.</p><p>In a mixing ventilation system, the goal is for clean air to be evenly distributed throughout the space. This is typically achieved through the use of ceiling diffusers, which help to disperse air evenly throughout the room. The diffusers also ensure the air is supplied with the correct velocity (called throw) so that it will be properly mixed with air in the room.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/640/1*6rVXqxmlUFsXnDHvO4NogA.jpeg" /><figcaption>Supply diffusers on a ceiling to ensure proper air distribution in the space.</figcaption></figure><p>However, if air supply and return vents are placed too close together, or if the supplied air is too warm or too slow, the air may not properly mix and may instead travel directly from the supply diffuser to the return grill, bypassing the breathing zone entirely. This is called short-circuiting.</p><p>Unit ventilators are designed without any air distribution and just supply outdoor air to the side of the room.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ap39Y_L-C0Y49nWOguUq7Q.jpeg" /><figcaption>An Energy Recovery Ventilator installed on the side of a room without any regard to air distribution. Credit: <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidElfstrom">David Elfstrom</a></figcaption></figure><h3>Measuring and checking ventilation</h3><p>There are several tools available to check and ensure proper ventilation.</p><ol><li><strong>CO2 Monitoring:</strong> CO2 monitoring is an indirect way to measure the ventilation rate in a space. It works by calculating the difference between indoor and outdoor CO2 levels, as we know the rate at which people exhale CO2. By monitoring the indoor CO2 concentration, one can estimate the ventilation rate and determine if the space meets requirements for adequate ventilation. This method is advantageous as it can be done by occupants and accounts for air distribution. However, there are caveats with how it should be used and interpreted. A detailed description of CO2 monitoring can be found <a href="https://itsairborne.com/intro-to-monitoring-co2-20f191dd8f60">here</a>.</li><li><strong>Airflow Checking:</strong> Checking the airflow rate in a space is a straightforward way to determine if the HVAC system is functioning. One method is to attach a tissue to a diffuser and observe whether it flaps continuously while occupied. Alternatively, a broomstick with a tissue taped to the end can be used to see if air is being delivered to a space. However, this method does not provide information on the quality of the supplied air or its distribution throughout the space. For example, if dampers are broken and all the air is recirculated, monitoring the airflow will not identify this issue.</li><li><strong>Pollutant Study: </strong>Pollutant studies can be done by using a measurable tracer gas or aerosol which is placed in the air. Any sources of that tracer is then removed and an instrument is used to measure how quickly that tracer is removed from the room. The air change rate in the room can then be <a href="https://itsairborne.com/how-to-compare-air-cleaning-devices-819e6ed5daa3#2e68">calculated</a>. This method can identify low ventilation problems or possibly air distribution issues, depending on where the measurement instrument is located. It only performs a measurement at one point in time. This method will tell you the air change rate, but that is not the proper metric when assessing the risk of a space, so these measurements still require proper <a href="https://itsairborne.com/air-changes-per-hour-flow-per-person-flow-per-area-what-is-the-right-metric-for-clean-air-a7e972ea4999#ed0a">interpretation</a>.</li><li><strong>Fog study:</strong> Fog generators can help identify problems with air distribution, such as stagnant or poorly ventilated areas, and pinpoint problem areas that require adjustments. It can also give an idea of how quickly pollutants can be removed from the room. This method is also done at a single point in time and does not observe the system continually while occupied.</li><li><strong>Professional Commissioning: </strong>Professional commissioning involves observing the air handling unit to ensure that it is functioning correctly. It includes observing if the fan is turning on, if the dampers are moving correctly, if outdoor air is being brought in, and if air is being exhausted. Air balancers have tools to measure the exact airflow and confirm that the system is complying with the design. Airflow can also be measured in the rooms by air balancers. When air handling units alone are commissioned, air distribution issues might still exist in the space. Commissioning only provides a one-time snapshot and can assume that the air from the air handling unit is being delivered perfectly to the space, which is usually not the case.</li><li><strong>Building Automation System (BAS):</strong> A building automation system (BAS) is a computerized and automated system that controls the entire HVAC system in a building. Micro-controllers communicate with equipment to turn fans and pumps on and off, open and close valves, modulate dampers and more. Sensors placed throughout the building identify air and water temperatures, pressures, and equipment status. Facility managers can monitor equipment operation from a computer screen to ensure that everything is operating as designed. The BAS can provide continuous monitoring and alerts when equipment is not functioning as it should. It generally cannot identify air distribution issues and is not accessible to occupants.</li></ol><h3>Most common problems, diagnosis and solutions</h3><p>When it comes to HVAC systems, there are several common problems that can arise. Understanding how to diagnose and solve these issues is crucial to maintaining the efficiency and safety of the system.</p><p><strong>Fan not turning on</strong></p><p>If the fan is not turning on, there are several possible causes, including a blown fuse, a broken motor, a broken fan belt, a tripped low limit safety, or a schedule set incorrectly. Additionally, the thermostat may be in auto mode or someone may have turned it off. If the fan is not running, CO2 levels will increase, and tissues taped to the diffusers will stop moving. This is easily identifiable through any method of checking ventilation. The fan should be fixed immediately to ensure proper ventilation.</p><p><strong>Dampers not allowing in outdoor air</strong></p><p>If the dampers that control outdoor air are not opening, it can significantly limit the amount of outdoor air supplied to the space. Dampers can seize or the actuator that controls them can be broken. CO2 levels will increase, and the unit will need to be inspected to determine if the dampers are moving properly. A BAS should be able to identify this issue, and the dampers need to be fixed immediately.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DccKihbecQx6gtNUOFgTpA.png" /><figcaption>The BAS is commanding the dampers open, meaning all the return air should be exhausted and all the supply air should be outdoor air. There should be no recirculated air. However, the BAS is measuring 0% outdoor air indicating these dampers have actually failed.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Insufficient air distribution</strong></p><p>When air is not being properly distributed throughout a space, the only way to know is to measure the pollutants in the space using CO2 monitoring or a pollutant or fog study. Checking airflow from the diffusers or investigating the unit supplying the space may not identify the issue. To solve this problem, fans or HEPA filters can be used to improve air distribution.</p><p><strong>Insufficient ventilation at minimum values</strong></p><p>Variable volume systems are often only measured at maximum ventilation levels and not at minimum levels. Sometimes, these systems are set to shut off ventilation completely when run at minimum, or they ramp down too low. Many modern air handling units are designed by the manufacturer to slow down when heating or cooling are not required, even though it should be a constant volume system. This can violate the minimum ventilation requirements.</p><p>The best way to diagnose this problem is through CO2 monitoring. Knowing the expected maximum CO2 concentrations can identify if the minimum airflow rates are insufficient. The expected steady state CO2 concentrations can be found <a href="https://itsairborne.com/intro-to-monitoring-co2-20f191dd8f60#631f">here</a>. Increasing the minimum ventilation levels can help solve this problem, and a technician may need to adjust the equipment to ensure it does not reduce the airflow too much.</p><p><strong>Broken BAS Sensors</strong></p><p>Many sensors break over time or wires get disconnected. Once these sensors break, the system no longer works properly. It’s a common issue and when ventilation or HVAC systems are neglected, this can go unnoticed. These sensors need to be fixed or replaced.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jjMCKcehdHasSBP01VdOXA.jpeg" /><figcaption>On this BAS, the supply air temperature is reading -60.1 °F. This value is clearly incorrect and indicative of a broken sensor.

Even in winter, cracking them open can make a difference. Installing a fan to exhaust air out of one window while leaving another open can significantly increase airflow. For maximum effectiveness, windows on opposite sides of the building should be opened.</p><p>For mechanical ventilation, if the system is controlled by a thermostat, the fan should be set to “on” when the space is occupied and switched to “auto” when unoccupied.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/369/1*c_Xdha35b2Y0-5QtIhQi5Q.png" /></figure><p>An important first step to improve ventilation, is to identify possible air distribution problems. If these issues exist, they can be mitigated through the use of HEPA filters or fans to mix the air in the room better. Adjusting the BAS to lower the temperature of the air when supplied from the ceiling can also be done, provided it does not cause thermal comfort issues.</p><p>These are other methods to improve mechanical ventilation:</p><ul><li>Systems that recirculate air can be improved by increasing the percentage of outdoor air and decreasing the amount of recirculated air. This can impact energy consumption.</li><li>Demand controlled ventilation, which reduces ventilation when CO2 levels are low, can be disabled or limited to ensure high airflow rates when the space has partial occupancy.</li><li>By replacing an air handling unit that recirculates air with one that includes heat recovery and provides more outdoor air, energy consumption can be kept to a minimum while greatly improving ventilation rates. This would have a higher capital cost, but provide significantly improved ventilation with little additional operating costs.</li><li>If the ventilation system is variable volume, the amount of air supplied can be increased when operating at minimum ventilation levels.</li></ul><p>A summary of available options for occupants can be found in this infographic:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*yVkdFBg0t7Dn7-RXNvnCLQ.png" /></figure><p>The other tools to provide clean air are filtration and UV. To improve filtration, it can be done in the air handling unit by upgrading the filters or by using portable HEPA filters.

I’ve worked with 3 graphic artists who have helped put this together. <a href="https://twitter.com/AnaSofiaPinho">Ana Sofia Pinho</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/DropletDiaries">Droplet Diaries</a> have been immensely helpful. <a href="https://twitter.com/alisagrossutti">Alisa Grossutti</a> is the one who created the final design and brought it to completion (<a href="https://www.overthemoonstudio.ca/home">Over The Moon Studio</a>). They’ve done an amazing job. <a href="https://twitter.com/DianeEllison">Diane Ellison</a> has helped throughout as a project manager and this would not have been completed without her.</p><p>While ventilation and air quality primarily depend on the facility manager or building operator, occupants have 5 tools to help clean the air and ensure it is acceptable.</p><h3><strong>Windows and Doors</strong></h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*vwGlsyMmdb3tNQECDddOmg.png" /></figure><p>This is the ventilation tool everyone can have in their room. Even windows being cracked open slightly can have an improvement on air quality.</p><h3><strong>Air Movement</strong></h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/298/1*ONLMX9WRad5qIdB8WalH8A.png" /></figure><p>One of the more common problems is that the ventilation system is not on at all (broken fan) or that it is set to turn off periodically during the day. In schools, offices or other commercial settings, this should never happen. Ventilation should always be on. You can always tape a tissue onto a meter stick or broom handle and hold it up to the diffuser to watch it flap. A better solution is to tape it there permanently so you can always check it without any effort.</p><h3><strong>Thermostat</strong></h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/369/1*c_Xdha35b2Y0-5QtIhQi5Q.png" /></figure><p>This is very common in strip malls and many other settings. The unit supplying air to the space has two functions — ventilation (supplying outdoor air) and climate control (heating and cooling). Putting the fan in auto mode means the unit only turns on if heating or cooling are necessary. If heating or cooling are not necessary, the unit will turn off and the ventilation will stop. You want the ventilation to be on all the time, so put the fan setting in On. At night, you don’t need to have ventilation in an unoccupied space, so turn it to Auto.</p><p>For your home, your furnace generally doesn’t have ventilation unless you have a ERV attached. If you are using your furnace to clean the air in your home, then also leave the fan on. For most people, it can be left in auto.</p><h3><strong>Carbon Dioxide</strong></h3><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/251/1*JrFO6y2syuIRUEiZvc-1Tw.png" /></figure><p>CO2 is the best tool occupants have to verify if the ventilation is working. Classrooms should remain under 1000 ppm if they are complying with minimum ventilation requirements. If they are consistently above 1000 ppm, you can ask the facility manager if the ventilation is working properly.

Measuring CO2 can help assess indoor air quality. The concentration of CO2 outdoors is typically around 420 parts per million (ppm) or 0.042%, but has been climbing over the decades as we burn fossil fuels. When people exhale, the concentration of CO2 in the exhaled air is about 40000 ppm or 4%. If a space is not adequately ventilated, the CO2 levels can increase, indicating that people are rebreathing air that has been previously exhaled (gaseous backwash).</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*ZqF9PSx2Hv2_SpAkSM04Jw.png" /><figcaption>Credit: <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidElfstrom">David Elfstrom</a></figcaption></figure><p>While CO2 is generally harmless in normal indoor quantities, elevated levels of CO2 can indicate poor indoor air quality, which can negatively affect human health and cognitive performance. Understanding CO2 levels can help us gauge the risk of airborne disease transmission and ensure adequate ventilation to maintain a healthy indoor environment.</p><h3>What values are safe?</h3><p>CO2 can be used in two ways to assess indoor air quality: as a proxy for ventilation or as a direct measurement of CO2 exposure. The American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists sets threshold limit values (TLVs) for CO2 exposure to ensure safe levels of the gas in the air. The <a href="https://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/chem_profiles/carbon_dioxide.html#section-10-hdr">TLV for CO2</a> is 5000 ppm for an 8-hour average and 30000 ppm for short-term exposure. However, it’s important to note that safe CO2 levels only relate to the direct exposure to CO2 and do not imply acceptable indoor air quality. Good ventilation levels are typically below 1000 ppm, whereas poorly ventilated areas can range between 1000–3000 ppm. In most circumstances, there is low concern about exceeding CO2 TLVs.</p><h3>What is an acceptable CO2 level for indoor environments?</h3><p>Since CO2 concentration is a measure of the balance between its generation and removal, an alternative question is: what is an acceptable outdoor airflow rate? Outdoor airflow rates are not designed to mitigate airborne disease transmission, but to ensure overall comfort for most occupants and are found in ventilation standards. By answering this question, you can calculate the expected CO2 level in a building that complies with the required outdoor airflow rate. The Ontario Society of Professional Engineers has developed a helpful calculator to estimate the expected CO2 levels in indoor spaces that meet the current ventilation standards: <a href="http://ospe-calc.herokuapp.com/">http://ospe-calc.herokuapp.com/</a>.</p><p>Here are some typical CO2 levels reported in <a href="https://ospe.on.ca/indoor-air-quality/">OSPE’s indoor air quality reports</a> for different settings:</p><ul><li>Daycare centers: 850 ppm</li><li>Elementary school classrooms: 900 ppm</li><li>High school classrooms: 1150 ppm</li><li>Offices: 1050 ppm</li><li>Retail stores: 1300 ppm</li><li>Doctor’s offices: 1000 ppm</li><li>Dental procedure rooms: 800 ppm</li></ul><p>(Warning: this next part uses math, you can skip it)</p><p>To understand where these CO2 values originate, it requires some math and knowledge of engineering standards. There are three steps to determining acceptable CO2 levels inline with current standards:</p><p>First, calculate the required outdoor airflow rate based on the ventilation rate procedure (VRP) in <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/standards-and-guidelines">ASHRAE 62.1</a>, which is the standard for North America. The VRP uses two values from Table 6–1: the flow per person and flow per area. These values are used to determine the total outdoor airflow rate in liters per second (lps). For example, suppose you have a typical classroom with 25 people and 85 square meters. Using Table 6–1, the flow per person is 5 lps and the flow per square meter is 0.6 lps. You can then calculate the outdoor airflow rate as follows:<br>Outdoor airflow rate = (5 lps/person × 25 people) + (0.6 lps/m² × 85 m²)<br>Outdoor airflow rate = 176 lps<br>Outdoor airflow rate per person = 176 lps / 25 people<br>Outdoor airflow rate per person = 7 lps/person</p><p>Second, to determine the CO2 generation rate, you can use this <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5666301/">table</a> that provides CO2 generation based on age, gender, and activity level.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1019/1*IZHtQBs4oxfA3PHRPqSf3Q.png" /></figure><p>For example, if you have a 15-year-old male student who is sitting and writing in a classroom, his metabolic rate is 1.3 according to the first table. Using the second table, you can determine the corresponding CO2 generation rate, which is between 0.0041 and 0.0048 lps. This equates to around 0.0045 l/s per person.</p><p>Finally, once you have the outdoor airflow rate and CO2 generation rate, you can use the following formula to calculate the steady-state indoor CO2 concentration:<br>Indoor CO2 = Outdoor CO2 + (generation rate × 1 000 000) / outdoor airflow rate</p><p>For example, using the values from the previous steps:<br>Indoor CO2 = 420 ppm + (0.0045 l/s per person × 1,000,000) / 7 lps/person<br>Indoor CO2 = 1062 ppm</p><p>This calculation provides an estimate of the steady-state indoor CO2 concentration. You can use this information to determine whether the indoor CO2 level meets acceptable levels for the space in question.</p><p>This is a plot of expected CO2 levels vs outdoor airflow rate per person.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/509/1*VsAyOMtp0wLTXKyZT1L0Ig.png" /></figure><p>The formula can also be reversed to diagnose outdoor airflow rate based on CO2 levels. For a classroom, if the steady state CO2 concentration is 1200 ppm, then the outdoor airflow rate is:<br>Outdoor airflow rate =(generation x 1 000 000)/(Indoor CO2 — Outdoor CO2)</p><p>= (0.0045 x 1000000)/(1200–420)=5.8 lps/person</p><p>This is lower than the minimum requirement in ASHRAE 62.1 and almost half of the 10 lps/person recommended by the <a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/rest/bitstreams/1333991/retrieve">WHO</a>.</p><h3>Transient time and temporary readings</h3><p>Buildings are not completely airtight, and air can leak in and out through the building envelope, a process known as infiltration and exfiltration. If a room has been unoccupied for some time, the previously exhaled air by occupants would have leaked out of the building, and the CO2 levels in the room should be similar to the outdoor air CO2 levels of around 420 ppm.</p><p>As occupants spend more time in the space, the CO2 levels will begin to rise, which is referred to as the transient state. Once the rate at which CO2 is generated matches the rate at which it is removed, it reaches a steady state. In larger rooms, the air volume is greater, and it takes a longer time to reach the steady state, as illustrated in this plot:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/730/1*QFvnhuljvY8Jfc8XiK6pow.png" /><figcaption>A graph showing the transient state and steady state in two rooms. The smaller room (blue line) reaches steady state much quicker than the larger room (red line). The steady state concentration is independent of room size. The yellow area is the reduced concentration of the pollutant people would be exposed to in a larger room. <a href="http://portfolio.cpl.co.uk/CIBSE/202106/42/">http://portfolio.cpl.co.uk/CIBSE/202106/42/</a></figcaption></figure><p>However, other factors can temporarily affect the CO2 levels, such as a person breathing near the CO2 sensor, which can show a high CO2 concentration that does not represent the actual air quality of the space. Additionally, when people enter or leave the room, their metabolic rate increases, causing a temporary increase in CO2 levels.</p><h3>Assessing risk for COVID and other airborne disease transmission</h3><p>To assess the risk of airborne transmission of any pollutant, including infectious aerosols, it’s important to consider the concentration of that pollutant in the air. This concentration is affected by both the rate at which it’s generated and the rate at which it’s removed. When it comes to infectious aerosols and CO2, comparing their generation and removal can help us understand the relationship between them.</p><p>Infectious aerosols are generated by infectious people, and the rate of generation depends on the activity level.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*0RsPoLGEBPSMEWPOdJwccQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Figures showing aerosol generation based on different activities. Exercising (purple), singing (blue), and talking (magenta) have much higher rates than breathing alone (yellow). <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23744235.2022.2140822">https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23744235.2022.2140822</a></figcaption></figure><p>CO2, on the other hand, is generated by all people and combustion reactions, and is removed through ventilation or sorbent-based removal systems. Infectious aerosols can be removed by various means, such as ventilation, filtration, UV light, natural decay, or deposition (landing on surfaces).</p><p>Here’s how infectious aerosols and CO2 are related:</p><ul><li>CO2 generation increases with more people, and so does the risk of having an infectious person present.</li><li>CO2 and infectious aerosol generation both increase with higher activity level.</li><li>CO2 and infectious aerosol concentration both increase with poor ventilation.</li></ul><p>However, there are also ways in which CO2 is not related to the risk of airborne disease transmission:</p><ul><li>When people are just exhaling and not talking or exercising, infectious aerosol generation can be very low, but CO2 generation can still be at a normal level.</li><li>Filtration and UV light can reduce the concentration of infectious aerosols in the air, but they do not affect CO2 levels.</li><li>If CO2 is generated from combustion reactions or sublimating dry ice, the CO2 concentration will increase without an increase in infectious aerosol concentration.</li><li>CO2 can be removed from the air through sorbent-based removal systems, but these systems are not designed to capture particulate matter like infectious aerosols.</li><li>Infectious aerosols are only generated by infectious people. If there are no infectious people present, there is no risk of transmission, even if CO2 levels are high.</li><li>In larger rooms, infectious aerosols have a larger volume of air to disperse in, which means they have a longer average travel distance before reaching a susceptible person. This increased travel distance increases the time between emission and inhalation, which allows more time for infectious aerosols to decay or settle out of the air before being inhaled. Therefore, the risk of infection from airborne transmission is generally lower in larger rooms compared to smaller rooms with the same number of people. CO2 does not decay or settle.</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/about/position%20documents/pd_indoorcarbondioxide_2022.pdf">ASHRAE’s position</a> is that “all else being equal, higher CO2 concentrations correspond to lower outdoor air ventilation rates and the potential for an increased risk of airborne transmission” while acknowledging many of the limitations stated here.</p><p>Therefore, the best use of CO2 monitoring is to ensure that ventilation is functioning properly, as ventilation is the main method used to ensure adequate air quality. Monitoring CO2 levels can be a helpful tool in an overall strategy to ensure a healthy indoor environment.</p><h3>What is a good CO2 level?</h3><p>According to ASHRAE’s <a href="https://www.ashrae.org/file%20library/about/position%20documents/pd_indoorcarbondioxide_2022.pdf">position document</a> on indoor air CO2: “An indoor CO2 concentration below 1000 ppm has long been considered an indicator of acceptable IAQ”. This value corresponds to the CO2 levels found in many classrooms and offices according to ASHRAE 62.1 standards. However, this is a general measure of air quality and does not necessarily indicate a low risk of airborne virus transmission. When considering airborne virus transmission, the first step is to determine the recommended non-infectious airflow rates, as outlined by the <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5ef3652ab722df11fcb2ba5d/t/637740d40f35a9699a7fb05f/1668759764821/Lancet+Covid+Commission+TF+Report+Nov+2022.pdf">Lancet COVID-19 Commission</a>.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*d4LnHMKSQyFqnRadH7Sikw.png" /></figure><p>Assuming all clean air is supplied through outdoor air, and not through filtration or UV, a ventilation rate of more than 14 lps/person — considered the “best” value — would lead to a CO2 concentration of less than 700 ppm. The “good” value, as recommended by WHO at 10 lps/person, corresponds to a CO2 level of 800 ppm.</p><p>As a generalization:</p><p>&lt;600 ppm — very good<br>600–800 ppm — good<br>800–1000 ppm — adequate<br>1000–1500 ppm — poor<br>&gt;1500 ppm — very poor</p><h3>Comparing two cases and assessing risk</h3><p>When comparing two situations and assessing risk, it’s important to use the correct metric. The metric that matters for airborne virus transmission is infectious aerosol generation versus total airflow. Let’s consider two cases: the first case involves two people, one of whom is infectious, with 15 lps of outdoor air per person and 700 ppm CO2. The second case involves ten people, one of whom is infectious, with 5 lps of outdoor air per person and 1250 ppm CO2.</p><p>In the first case, the total airflow is 30 lps, while in the second case, the total airflow is 50 lps. However, since the infectious aerosol generation is the same in both cases, the second case with more people and higher CO2 would still be considered lower risk because the total airflow per infectious person is higher.</p><p>It’s important to note that this does not mean 1250 ppm is a low-risk level, but rather that 700 ppm is much higher risk than would be expected in this case. As a general rule of thumb, low CO2 levels should not be used as an indicator of low risk if there are fewer than ten people in a confined space. As the number of people increases, the risk increases due to the higher likelihood of encountering an infectious individual.</p><h3>What alternatives are there to CO2 monitoring?</h3><p>Although CO2 monitoring is not a perfect method for monitoring ventilation, it is currently the best tool available. Other methods include the building automation system (BAS), airflow monitoring, and air balancing measurements.</p><p>The BAS is a computerized system that controls HVAC equipment and can provide information on whether the equipment is operating properly, including how much outdoor air is being supplied to the space and the temperature of the air at different locations in the air handling unit. Here is a typical display of an air handling unit from a BAS:</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/625/1*jEG3RjHluPSMGy05Pu3gIw.png" /><figcaption><a href="https://blog.veris.com/air-handling-unit-ahu-applications">https://blog.veris.com/air-handling-unit-ahu-applications</a></figcaption></figure><p>Airflow stations connected to the BAS can also be used to measure airflow, but they require proper maintenance for dust and can lose accuracy over time. However, these methods do not necessarily provide transparency to occupants or account for issues with air distribution in the space.</p><p>Air balancing measurements can be taken by an air balancer, but these measurements may not reflect the actual ventilation rate for occupants under all conditions. Additionally, these measurements are typically taken at one point in time and may not account for changes in equipment or conditions.</p><p>One simple method to confirm airflow to the space is to attach a tissue to the diffuser or end of a stick, but this method does not provide an accurate measurement of airflow rate or the proportion of outdoor air to recirculated air. However, one of the most common problems with ventilation is equipment that is not running and this test can notify the occupants immediately when that occurs. It was used in New York to verify ventilation.</p><p><a href="https://ny.chalkbeat.org/2020/8/26/21403495/tissue-paper-test-ventilation-nyc-schools">Toilet paper on a stick? It&#39;s just one way to test ventilation in NYC schools.</a></p><p>In comparison, CO2 monitoring in the space is an inexpensive and widely available method that accounts for air distribution and provides an accurate measurement of airflow rate per person. While it is not a perfect method, it is currently the best option for monitoring ventilation.</p><h3>How to use a CO2 monitor</h3><p>To use a CO2 monitor, it’s recommended to use the most accurate sensor called non dispersive infrared (NDIR). When placing the CO2 monitor, avoid placing it near people, windows, doors or air vents. Instead, it should be placed at a height of 1.5 m on a wall in a location that is representative of the air being inhaled by the occupants. Avoid placing it inside HVAC ducts as it may not represent the same pollutant concentration as the space.</p><p>CO2 measurements can be used to quickly gauge how much air is being rebreathed. However, in places where people must be present like schools, offices, healthcare facilities or congregate living settings, steady state CO2 levels can be used to determine if the ventilation is meeting current standards.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=20f191dd8f60" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://itsairborne.com/intro-to-monitoring-co2-20f191dd8f60">Intro to Monitoring CO2</a> was originally published in <a href="https://itsairborne.com">It’s Airborne</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>

In the corner of the room there is an upper room UV picture. Photo was taken by <a href="https://twitter.com/kprather88">Dr. Kimberly Prather</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Ultraviolet Germicidal Irradiation (UVGI), also known as Germicidal Ultraviolet (GUV) simply refers to using UV light to inactivate microbes like viruses, bacteria or fungi. They will still be floating in the air or found on surfaces and you will still touch them, ingest them or inhale them, but they become harmless.</p><p>There are many different ways UV light can be used and it often causes confusion. To know whether the UV system you are using is extremely effective, okay, useless or harmful, you need to be able to recognize the different types.</p><h3>How is UV light created?</h3><p>We have a few different methods to create UV light. <a href="https://uvsolutionsmag.com/stories/pdf/archives/060401Heering_2004.pdf">Here</a> is a review of the different methods. For GUV, the most common is low pressure mercury lamps which is how we make fluorescent light bulbs. They emit UVC light at 254 nm. The only difference is fluorescent bulbs have a phosphor coating which take the UV light and convert it into visible light. UV lamps have no coating and let the UV light pass through. They primarily emit UV light at 254 nm but also have a light blue glow in the visible spectrum.</p><p>This wavelength of light is very effective against microbes, but can also have bad effects when it is shone on people including erythema (skin reddening) and photokeratitis (like sand in your eyes). Unlike UV-B, it does not have a skin cancer risk because the wavelengths of light do not penetrate well into the deeper layers of skin.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*mpjLCUcOKfs_GpWL_6IQOw.png" /><figcaption><a href="https://www.uottawa.ca/about-us/administration-services/office-risk-management">https://www.uottawa.ca/about-us/administration-services/office-risk-management</a></figcaption></figure><p>These lamps are very cheap to make, so to use them against diseases, there needs to be a way to expose pathogens to UV light without exposing people. There are a few ways to do this.</p><h3>Surface Cleaning</h3><p>This is one of the most common ways UV light is used. If you see an exposed light bulb, it can’t be used for cleaning the air in occupied rooms. People would need to leave the room and then the light can be turned on to disinfect any surfaces the light irradiates.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*FDj9ebdiyYXuqD1yMCpa0Q.jpeg" /><figcaption>Steripro by <a href="https://www.uvc-solutions.com/">https://www.uvc-solutions.com/</a> . This cannot be used when people are in the room.</figcaption></figure><p>It can also be used as a light bulb but only turned on when the room is empty.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/948/1*3VrzebM5V_OogwmU_OfAOQ.png" /><figcaption>Liatris UV lamp. <a href="https://uv-can.com/collections/uv-surface-disinfection/products/liatris-uv-c-tube-light">https://uv-can.com/collections/uv-surface-disinfection/products/liatris-uv-c-tube-light</a></figcaption></figure><p>UV lights can also be shone inside containers and items to be disinfected can be placed in there.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/824/1*XirAESvEwW3w_4KGaxbTJg.png" /><figcaption>The inside of a UV disinfection case. <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/product-recommendations/lifestyle/best-uv-sanitizers-1112268/">https://www.rollingstone.com/product-recommendations/lifestyle/best-uv-sanitizers-1112268/</a> . As seen from this article, it was mistakenly believed that using UV as surface cleaning equipment is effective against COVID. The article does not address using UV as air cleaning technology.</figcaption></figure><p>One other common method is UV wands, which are portable surface cleaning devices.</p><p>All these methods are for cleaning surfaces and have some advantages over cleaning surfaces with chemical disinfectants. However, respiratory viruses are airborne and spread primarily through the air. The current evidence about the spread of COVID-19 through surfaces indicates it is <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/science-and-research/surface-transmission.html">low risk</a>. These technologies do not clean the air in occupied spaces and should not be considered as a method of mitigating COVID transmission or a primary mitigation tool for other respiratory viruses. They can be effective, especially in healthcare settings, against bacteria and other pathogens which spread through surfaces. For mitigating the spread of COVID and respiratory infections, the focus should be on cleaning air.</p><h3>Air Handling Units</h3><p>Air handling units (or AHUs) are what supply air to spaces. Sometimes they supply 100% outdoor air which is already virus free, so it does not require disinfection. Often, they have a lot of recirculated air, so instead of letting it recirculate microbes and resupply them to the space, you can insert UV lamps inside AHUs to disinfect all the air that is passing through.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/682/1*-BZxfWkXEn9f-b69xC2hBg.png" /><figcaption>Picture of UV lights placed both near the coil and in the supply duct of an air handling unit. <a href="https://www.agcoombs.com.au/news-and-publications/advisory-notes/ultraviolet-germicidal-irradiation-for-hvac-applications/">https://www.agcoombs.com.au/news-and-publications/advisory-notes/ultraviolet-germicidal-irradiation-for-hvac-applications/</a></figcaption></figure><p>The unit in the picture has UV lights in two separate locations. The lower place is by the cooling coil of the unit. When cooling the air is necessary, air is passed though the unit through a coil with either cold water or refrigerant inside the coil to cool down the air. When this happens, water condenses out of the air and ends up on the coil where it can cause microbial growth. Using UV lights by the coil can prevent this problem. When UV systems are designed for this, they are generally not sized with enough irradiance and contact time to effectively disinfect the air.</p><p>The UV lights above are installed parallel to the duct. This is to increase the amount of time the air is exposed to UV light. These should be sized to be effective at disinfecting the air.</p><p>UV lights are also designed to be placed inside your furnace to disinfect any microbes that could be recirculating.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/435/1*zxYZFODGGRp3lU0JAbDjkQ.png" /><figcaption>Swordfish UV lamp designed to be placed in a home furnace. <a href="https://swordfishuv.com/products/swordfish-air-36w-whole-home-unit">https://swordfishuv.com/products/swordfish-air-36w-whole-home-unit</a></figcaption></figure><p>One of the biggest problems with these systems is the contact time. For a pathogen to become inactivated, it requires a sufficient dose. The dose is the irradiance (power of the light over an area) and the exposure time. Since there is such a small exposure time, the irradiance must be very high. These systems can sometimes be installed with insufficient dose to be effective.</p><p>Another issue is that an alternative to these systems is improved filtration. Upgrading the filter in an HVAC unit to MERV-13 can also remove pathogens. Filtration has the benefit of also removing other particulate matter in the air. Improving filtration and installing in-duct UV at the same time would have diminishing returns, so there is little benefit of using them together. <a href="https://medium.com/its-airborne/introduction-to-air-filtration-172704a73dd4#b88b">One of the issues with filtration</a> is that some AHUs cannot handle better filters and filters can get loaded with dust and restrict ventilation, which is not a concern with UV lights.</p><h3>UV in a Box</h3><p>Instead of using an air handling unit, you can add devices to the room to disinfect the air. It requires a box, a fan and a UV light. The fan pulls the air into the box where it is exposed to UV light and then supplies the disinfected air back to the space. This can be mounted on the ceiling or wall.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/897/1*wqd7JiPiXCaBJxVzgn_irA.png" /><figcaption>Galax UV Ceiling Panel. It is installed in the ceiling. A fan pulls the air in, filters the air, exposes it to UV light and supplies it back to the space. There is no UV light exposure to the space. <a href="https://uv-can.com/collections/uv-air-disinfection/products/galax-uv-c-air-purifier-ceiling-panel">https://uv-can.com/collections/uv-air-disinfection/products/galax-uv-c-air-purifier-ceiling-panel</a></figcaption></figure><p>It can also be done as a portable air cleaning device, just like portable HEPA filters.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/401/1*lNvfBu_u0PYAZZ07rgXz6A.png" /><figcaption>Sanuvox P900 portable air cleaner. Air is drawn into the box using a fan, exposed to UV light and then resupplied to the space. <a href="https://sanuvox.com/product/p900-residential/">https://sanuvox.com/product/p900-residential/</a></figcaption></figure><p>The issue of contact time exists for these devices as well. Ones sold by reputable companies should provide the disinfection rate with lab tests. They can also have all the same <a href="https://itsairborne.com/introduction-to-air-filtration-172704a73dd4#b88b">disadvantages of in-room filtration</a>: noise, air distribution and human operation.</p><p>Another consideration is these devices are often accompanied with a HEPA filter (the Galax UV air is). HEPA filters can remove more than 99.95% of particles that pass through them. There is little benefit to having UV in a box if there is already a HEPA filter. Similarly, if a HEPA filter is advertised as having UV as an addition, the UV likely provides little benefit.</p><h3>Upper Room UV</h3><p>A full introduction to upper room UV can be found <a href="https://itsairborne.com/intro-to-upper-room-uvgi-a36e00862c04">here</a>. Going back 80 years, a different method of using UV to disinfect the air was used. Divide the room into two parts: the upper room or disinfection zone is the space between the tops of people’s heads and the ceiling, while the lower room or breathing zone is where people reside. Fixtures are designed to emit UV light into the upper room without exposing people in the lower room to harmful levels of UV light.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DMTBWxuc_y7luhi76FQcpw.jpeg" /><figcaption><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/ventilation/uvgi.html">CDC </a>image of an upper-room UV installation. Fixtures on the wall shine UV light into the upper-room or disinfection zone. People below in the lower room or breathing zone are not exposed to UV light.</figcaption></figure><p>Pathogens are constantly floating around the room. When an infectious person emits respiratory aerosols, they will eventually float into the upper room, where they will be disinfected and then will not infect others when they return to the lower room and are inhaled.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*47DQ5_TWRuC6bxJhLh54mQ.jpeg" /><figcaption>Illustration of how upper-room UV works. First pathogens are released in respiratory particles from infectious people, they then circulate to the upper-room where they get inactivated and then return to the lower room where they cannot infect susceptible people. Picture from <a href="https://www.lightdis.com/en/inicio-english/">Lightdis</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>UV in an air handling unit can provide 2–4 air changes per hour if it is designed effectively. UV in a box can provide a similar rate. Upper room UV can provide 20–30 air changes per hour. It’s much more effective than the previous methods because it doesn’t rely on a fan to draw air. It constantly illuminates a significant percentage of the air in the room, providing a very high non-infectious air delivery rate.</p><p>To identify upper room UV fixtures, you can often see louvered fixtures mounted on the wall or ceiling.</p><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/922/1*xdsXVmx_8cCADD-MjLSo-w.jpeg" /><figcaption>Ceiling mounted upper room UV fixtures at Washington DCs DCA airport.

He is standing in front of two far-UV lamps pointing at him with purple coloured light. In the corner there is an upper room UV fixture with visible blue light. Photo taken by <a href="https://twitter.com/kprather88">Dr. Kimberly Prather</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>A full introduction to far-UV can be found <a href="https://itsairborne.com/intro-to-far-uv-7bcfae7a0cbb">here</a>. Far-UV does not use the blue glowing mercury lamps. It uses a more recently discovered Krypton Chloride (KrCl) excimer lamp. It does not emit light at 254 nm, but around 222 nm. This has one significant difference.</p><p>UV light between 200 nm and 230 nm is known as far-UV and is really poor at penetrating anything. Your skin has an outer layer of dead skin called the stratum corneum and your eyes have a tear layer over them. Consequently, your body has a thin layer of protection around it which far-UV cannot penetrate well.</p><p>There is a limit to how much UV light people can be exposed to per day. For UV 254 nm, the limit is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4854786/">6 mJ/cm²</a>. For UV 222 nm, the limit is <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.09.491217v1.full.pdf">160 mJ/cm²</a> for your eyes and <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.09.491217v1.full.pdf">479 mJ/cm²</a> for your skin. So the limit from far-UV is 27 x higher than UV 254 nm on your eyes and 80 x higher on your skin.</p><p>What this means is that you can design a far-UV system to shine in an occupied room and there will be no bad effects on the people while still being effective against airborne viruses. This cannot be done with other UV light.</p><p>While upper room UV can give 20–30 air changes per hour, far-UV can give greater than <a href="https://itsairborne.com/intro-to-far-uv-7bcfae7a0cbb#aee9">100 air changes per hour</a>. It is the most effective system that exists.</p><p>There are still some <a href="https://itsairborne.com/intro-to-far-uv-7bcfae7a0cbb#7624">concerns</a> about the use of far-UV as it does not have the same long history of use like upper room UV does. Nevertheless, its use is growing and is showing promise as a safe and effective tool to disinfect the air in occupied rooms and mitigate the spread of airborne diseases.</p><h3>Photocatalytic Oxidation (PCO)</h3><p>UV light can be used in a way that is not germicidal. The goal with PCO is not to use UV to directly inactivate pathogens. UV PCO shines UV light on a surface which is a catalyst for chemical reactions. That surface is generally titanium dioxide (TiO2) but can also be cobalt or other materials.</p><p>When the photocatalyst is irradiated with UV light, a <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/21/1/56">chemical reaction </a>occurs where hydroxyl or superoxide radicals are formed and then released into the space. The goal is for these to react with pollutants and render them harmless.

Is that better than what a portable HEPA filter could do? What if it said it gives you 40 air changes per hour? How do you compare these?</p><p>Often, the data that is given is not sufficient to determine if something is effective. Here is how you would need to determine it.</p><p>Content Warning: Math — logarithms and differential equations</p><p>Acronyms I’ll be using:<br>CADR = Clean air delivery rate<br>CFM = airflow in cubic feet per minute<br>lps = airflow in liters per second<br>m³/h = airflow in meters cubed per hour<br>AC = air changes<br>eAC = equivalent air changes<br>ACH = air changes per hour<br>eACH = equivalent air changes per hour</p><h3>Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR)</h3><p>Ultimately, this is what you need to know about any device you purchase — the rate at which it can supply clean air. CADR is typically measured in volumetric flow rate, such as cubic feet per minute (CFM), liters per second (lps), or meters cubed per hour (m³/h). This information should be provided by the manufacturer for portable HEPA filters, so you don’t need to perform any additional calculations.</p><p>To know if the device will be effective for the space, you need to use a metric like airflow per person. Air changes per hour is often used as well, but all metrics have their limitations. See <a href="https://itsairborne.com/air-changes-per-hour-flow-per-person-flow-per-area-what-is-the-right-metric-for-clean-air-a7e972ea4999">this post</a> to determine if a certain CADR is sufficient.</p><h3>Air Changes per Hour (ACH)</h3><p>Air Changes per Hour (ACH) is a measure of how many times the air in a room is replaced with fresh air per hour. ACH is used when the air in a room is replaced (like ventilation), while the equivalent ACH (eACH) is used when the air is disinfected (with UV) instead. Sometimes they are used interchangeably. If a device claims to provide a certain amount of ACH or eACH, this value is only meaningful for the room where the test was conducted. When put in a different room, the ACH can be very different.</p><p>To convert from ACH to CADR, you can use the following formula: <br>ACH = CADR * unit conversions/ volume of the room (EQ-1)</p><p>For example, if a room is 30 m³ and the CADR is 50 m³/h, then the ACH would be: ACH = 50 / 30 = 1.7 ACH</p><p>If the flow rate units are CFM, then the unit conversion factor is 60 minutes per hour. For instance, if you have a 7200 ft³ classroom and a Corsi-Rosenthal box with a CADR of 500 CFM, then the ACH would be: <br>ACH = 60 x 500 / 7200 = 4.2 ACH</p><p>You can also reverse the formula to calculate CADR if you’re given ACH and room volume to compare the device to a HEPA filter: <br>CADR = ACH * volume / unit conversion (EQ-2)</p><p>For example, if a unit claims to provide 30 ACH and the room volume is 20 m³, then the CADR would be: CADR = 30 x 20= 600 m³/h</p><p>As a final example, if you want to find the CADR in CFM for 6 ACH in a 7200 ft³ classroom, the calculation would be: <br>CADR = 6 * 7200 / 60 = 720 CFM</p><p>It’s important to note that if you’re given an ACH without knowing the volume of the room, the value is meaningless. Therefore, it’s crucial to have both pieces of information to accurately calculate CADR.</p><h3>% Reduction</h3><p>Using the percentage of virus reduced within an hour can be a misleading way to market an air cleaner as the savior of humanity. While this value may seem effective, it can be deceptive and requires careful math to determine the true effectiveness of the device.</p><p>The percentage reduction is often used for UV light and electronic air cleaning products because their main goal is to inactivate the virus, rather than providing clean air. However, calculating an equivalent CADR can be challenging. Moreover, the virus naturally decays over time, so those values must be subtracted to obtain an accurate result.</p><p>Be wary of any manufacturer that only provides the percentage reduction without disclosing the underlying data or methodology. There are calculators to identify this as shown here or in the <a href="http://ospe-calc.herokuapp.com/Air_Cleaners">OSPE calculator</a>, but I’ll go through the math to explain it.</p><h3>Elliott Gall on Twitter: &quot;Wondering what that &quot;99% reduction in 1 h&quot; air cleaner is actually doing in your space? We made the air cleaner efficacy investigation tool (ACE IT) to help evaluate often opaque performance data. https://t.co/MCzmY4ScGI w/ @built_envi @mheidarinejad @ChemDelphine @marwa_zaatari / Twitter&quot;</h3><p>Wondering what that &quot;99% reduction in 1 h&quot; air cleaner is actually doing in your space? We made the air cleaner efficacy investigation tool (ACE IT) to help evaluate often opaque performance data. https://t.co/MCzmY4ScGI w/ @built_envi @mheidarinejad @ChemDelphine @marwa_zaatari</p><p>When cleaning a certain volume of air, the amount of active virus removed is proportional to the concentration of that virus in the air. This can be expressed by the differential equation:<br>-d(virus removed)/d(volume of air removed) = C x virus concentration</p><p>where C is a constant. By solving this equation through integration, you can get:<br>% virus remaining = e^(- eAC)<br>Or % virus removed = 1 — e^(-eAC) (EQ-3)</p><p>For example, after 7 air changes, the % virus removed is 1 — e^-7 = 99.9%.</p><p>To determine the equivalent CADR for an air cleaner, you can rearrange EQ-3:<br>eAC = -ln(1-% virus removed) (EQ-4)</p><p>For instance, let’s say a HEPA filter unit with photocatalytic oxidation has been shown to remove VOCs by 90% after 3 hours in a 640 ft³ room. The eAC:<br>eAC= -ln(1-%VOC removed) = -ln(1–.9) = 2.3</p><p>So this unit provides 2.3 air changes in 3 hours, or 0.77 eACH. To convert this to CADR, we can use EQ-2:</p><p>CADR = ACH x volume/unit conversion = 0.77 eACH x 640 ft³ / (60 min/hour) = 8.2 CFM</p><p>8.2 CFM is an incredibly low CADR. Minimum requirements in a classroom would be around 350–400 CFM and a CR box provides around 500 CFM. Air leaking into the building (infiltration) would likely be much higher. Therefore, claiming 90% reduction in 3 hours in a tiny room is not particularly effective.</p><h3>Subtracting the Control</h3><p>Suppose a company selling air cleaning equipment claims that virus concentrations decreased by 99% in one hour with the equipment on and 50% with the equipment off. How effective is the equipment?</p><p>Using EQ-4, we can calculate the total equivalent air changes (eAC) as follows:<br>The total eAC = -ln(1–0.99) = 4.6 eAC<br>The control eAC = -ln(1–0.5) = 0.7 eAC</p><p>As discussed <a href="http://built-envi.com/what-air-cleaner-test-reports-dont-tell-you/">here</a>, we subtract the control eAC from the total eAC to find the contribution of the air cleaner, which is 3.9 eAC.</p><p>Sometimes, log reductions are used to report effectiveness, with log 1 reduction indicating 90% removal, log 2 indicating 99% removal, log 3 indicating 99.9% removal and so on. The formula for calculating the percentage of pathogen removed is:</p><p>% removed = 1–10^-log reduction (EQ-5)</p><p>For instance, if there was a 4.2 log reduction, % removed = 1–10^-4.2 = 99.994%.</p><p>Let’s consider an example. An air cleaner claims a 3.3 log reduction of a pathogen in 3 minutes with the equipment on (test) and a 0.8 log reduction in 3 minutes with the equipment off (control). The chamber size is 5.3 ft³. How effective is the air cleaner?</p><p>We can first use EQ-5 to calculate the percentage of pathogen removed as follows:<br>Control: % removed = 1–10^-0.8 = 84%<br>Test: % removed = 1–10^-3.3 = 99.95%</p><p>Next, we can use EQ-4 to convert the percentages to eAC:<br>Control: eAC = -ln(1–0.84) = 1.8 eAC<br>Test: eAC = -ln(1–0.9995) = 7.6 eAC</p><p>Subtracting the control eAC from the test eAC, we get 7.6–1.8 = 5.8 eAC. Since this happened in 3 minutes, the equivalent air changes per hour (eACH) is 5.8 * 60 min/hour /3 minutes = 116 eACH.</p><p>Finally, we can use EQ-2 to convert the eACH into an equivalent clean air delivery rate (CADR):</p><p>CADR = eACH * volume / unit conversion = 116 eACH * 5.3 ft³ / 60 = 10.2 CFM. For comparison, a typical CR box has a CADR of around 500 CFM, which is approximately 50 times better.</p><p>In summary, removing 99.95% of the pathogen in 3 minutes sounds impressive until we apply the appropriate calculations to understand the air cleaner’s actual effectiveness.</p><h3>Full Equation</h3><p>Here is the complete equation. If you are given:<br>V = room volume in ft³<br>T = time of the test in minutes<br>Lt = log reduction with the equipment on<br>Lc = log reduction with the equipment off</p><p>CADR (CFM)= V/T * ln(10^(Lt-Lc)) (EQ-6)</p><p>For metric units, where volume is in m³ and CADR is in m³/h, the formula is:</p><p>CADR=60*V/T * ln(10^(Lt-Lc))(EQ-7)</p><p>If you are given:<br>V = room volume in ft³<br>T = time of the test in minutes<br>%t=% removed during test with equipment on<br>%c= % removed with the equipment off</p><p>CADR (CFM) = V/T*(ln(1-%c)/(1-%t)) (EQ-8)</p><p>In metric units:<br>CADR (m³/h)=60*V/T*(ln(1-%c)/(1-%t)) (EQ-9)</p><h3>Conclusions</h3><p>When given information about log reduction or % of virus removed, you need to know how long it took, the size of the room and the values for the control test. Without that data, it’s meaningless.</p><p>A cleaner stated that in one hour, 99.9999% of particles were removed. How is that not effective? There are two math tricks to hide this. The first is that you do not need a high amount of air changes to achieve this — only 14. The second is due to the size of the room in which it was tested. If the room was very tiny, you can have a very high amount of air changes, but once you put that device into a full sized room, it is no longer effective.</p><p>As shown in one of the previous tests, the chamber was 5.3 ft³. For comparison, if you place a Corsi-Rosenthal box with 500 CFM there (it wouldn’t fit, but imagine it did), using EQ-1:<br>ACH = 500 *60/5.3=5660 ACH</p><p>To find the amount of virus removed, using EQ-3:<br>% removed = 1-e^(-ACH) = 1-e^(-5660)<br>The number is 99.9… with over 2000 9’s afterwards.</p><p>So the final conclusions are:</p><ol><li>Do not trust ACH or % reduction data alone. You need to do the math to see what CADR it actually gives to fairly compare it to other air cleaning methods.</li><li>Data that does not include the control test, chamber size and the time of the test is not meaningful.</li><li>Using a small chamber, you can obtain a high ACH or % reduction with equipment that is fairly ineffective in larger rooms.</li></ol><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=819e6ed5daa3" width="1" height="1" alt=""><hr><p><a href="https://itsairborne.com/how-to-compare-air-cleaning-devices-819e6ed5daa3">How to Compare Air Cleaning Devices</a> was originally published in <a href="https://itsairborne.com">It’s Airborne</a> on Medium, where people are continuing the conversation by highlighting and responding to this story.</p>]]></content:encoded>
